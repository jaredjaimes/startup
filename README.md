# Startup
Startup application for BYU CS260
### [notes](https://github.com/jaredjaimes/startup/blob/main/notes.md)

# Remember:
- Be simple: Do not start by implementing mutiple features. This project is about focusing on a core feature well.
- You can make it look nicer after you have made it work.
- **Demonstrating the technology is more important than complexity or creativity, and basic implementations of each of the course technologies is sufficient to demonstrate your mastery.**
- NOTE: MAke sure when deploying that you are in your startup file

## Elevator Pitch
Have you ever been stuck trying to complete the same life goal for years? Maybe you've tried getting in better shape, or have a better romantical life, but time and time again you lsot motivation and gave up. Well how about if I told you there was an app that made completeing tasks and reaching goals as addicting as video games, or learning languages on duolingo. Well introducing Life.io, this app allows users to create a virtual avatar that receives in app rewards when you complete a task, and lets you see your goal progress, so you actually see benefits immeadiatley after completeing a task. Making completing goals absolutely addicting.

## Technologies
#### HTML
3 HTML pages, one to organize and structure the login/ account creation, another for avatar creation/customization as well as creating main focus goals, another to create tasks for each focus goal that you want to accomplish. Then another page to view users highest rankings and friends progress. 

### CSS

### React
Page that displays avatar that reacts to user input for appearance, page that displays goals that react to user input to tract goals. 

### Web Service
Backend in service with endpoints for:
- Submitting goal information.
- Submitting progress for tracking goals.

- retrieving information of all users progress for high ranking in real time.

### DB/Login
Users login info, as well as, their goal history, and progress are stored in the database. You can't see others goals/ progress or share your progress unless authorized and having an account.

## React deliverable
‚û°Ô∏è The following is an example of the required information for the Startup React deliverable

For this deliverable I used JavaScript and React so that the application completely works for a single user.

 - [x] Bundled and transpiled - done! DId i do this? 
 - [x] Components - Login, skills, avatar, and ranking, the ranking is mock for websocket later and database storage.
 - [x] login - When you press create or the login button it redirects you to the skills page.
 - [x] database - Displayed the the player level and exp points, as well as avatar. Currently this is stored and retrieved from local storage, but it will be replaced with the database data later.
 - [x] WebSocket - In my rankings pager I use a setInterval function that periodically reads updates from localStorage, making it like websocket.
 - [x] application logic - Have a login component that allows users to login and shows different login states based on wether user has logged in or not. Have a avater desrption component that display the overall discription of the avatar based on user input. Then we have a skills page that allows users to create and complete tasks to earn exp points which are tracked by the rankings page. 
 - [x] React Router - Routing between home, skills, avatar, and ranking components. We 
 - [x] Hooks - the useNavigate hook to redirect user to different page when login, the useState to track username to remember user, and to track the authentication state, and password, and manage avatar customization, tasks state and skill state, and useEffect to manage to broadcast side effects a and skill updates.

DB/Login deliverable
‚û°Ô∏è The following is an example of the required information for the Startup DB/Login deliverable

 User registration - Creates a new account in the database.
 existing user - Stores the votes under the same user if the user already exists.

 Restricts functionality - You cannot vote until you have logged in. This is restricted on the frontend only. üòî
WebSocket deliverable
