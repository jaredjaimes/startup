### [notes](https://github.com/jaredjaimes/startup/blob/main/notes.md)

# Remember:
- Be simple: Do not start by implementing mutiple features. This project is about focusing on a core feature well.
- You can make it look nicer after you have made it work.
- **Demonstrating the technology is more important than complexity or creativity, and basic implementations of each of the course technologies is sufficient to demonstrate your mastery.**

## Elevator Pitch

Well introducing Life.io, this app allows users to create a virtual avatar that receives in app rewards when you complete a task, and lets you see your goal progress, so you actually see benefits immeadiatley after completeing a task. Making completing goals absolutely addicting.

For this deliverable I properly styled the application into its final appearance.

- [ ] **Header, footer, and main content body**
- [ ] **Navigation elements** - I dropped the underlines and changed the color for anchor elements.

- [ ] **Application text content** - Consistent fonts
- [ ] **Application images** - Still don't have images and so no styling here. ðŸ˜”
