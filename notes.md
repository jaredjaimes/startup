## Console:
- Also known as the command line, shell, or terminal, the console window is an essential web development tool. 
- When ever you use the **"vi"** command in the console. There are certain command that you can type in for it to work the way you need it to. You can find all those commands here: [vim cheat sheet](https://vim.rtorr.com/)
-  At any given point in time your console is located at one of the directories in the file system. You can see which directory you are in with the pwd (present working directory) command.
  
- echo - Output the parameters of the command
- cd - Change directory
- mkdir - Make directory
- rmdir - Remove directory
- rm - Remove file(s)
- mv - Move file(s)
- cp - Copy files
- ls - List files
- curl - Command line client URL browser
- grep - Regular expression search
- find - Find files
- top - View running processes with CPU and memory usage
- df - View disk statistics
- cat - Output the contents of a file
- less - Interactively output the contents of a file
- wc - Count the words in a file
- ps - View the currently running processes
- kill - Kill a currently running process
- sudo - Execute a command as a super user (admin)
- ssh - Create a secure shell on a remote computer
- scp - Securely copy files to a remote computer
- history - Show the history of commands
- ping - Check if a website is up
- tracert - Trace the connections to a website
- dig - Show the DNS information for a domain
- man - Look up a command in the manual

You can also chain the input and output of commands using special characters
```
 | - Take the output from the command on the left and pipe, or pass, it to the command on the right
 > - Redirect output to a file. Overwrites the file if it exists
 > - >> - Redirect output to a file. Appends if the file exists
```

For example, you can list the files in a directory, pipe it into grep to search for files created in Nov, and then pipe that into wc to count the number of files found with a date of Nov.
```
- ls -l | grep ' Nov ' | wc -l
```

There are also keystrokes that have special meaning in the console.
- CTRL-R - Use type ahead to find previous commands
- CTRL-C - Kill the currently running command


## Https and Tls, and web certificates
- Https is the secure HTTP.
- If you want to create a secure (HTTPS) connection to your application, then it is not possible with just an IP address. Instead you want to use a domain name to represent your web application. That way you can make it easy to remember and secure. In order for you to do this you need to buy a domain name, and then create DNS records with a DNS (Domain Name System) server.
- **Route 53** is the AWS service that handles everything DNS-related. With Route 53 you can buy a domain name, host your domain on their DNS servers, and create DNS records.
- Having a HTTPS means that all data is encrypted using TLS protocol.
- You can see the negotiating secret of TLS by using the curl and -v. EX:
```
curl -v -s https://byu.edu > /dev/null
```
-**Web certificates** are generated by a trusted 3rd party using public/private key encryption. The certificate issuer is responsible for verifying that the certificate owner actually owns the domain name represented by the certificate
- Web certificates used to cost hundreds of a dollars a year, to renew and to get. 
- Until two brothers created a non-profit org called Let's Encrypt that created trusted web certificates. This broke the monopoly.
- Modern browsers now expect web servers to exclusively use HTTPS for all communication. In fact, the next version of HTTP (v3) only supports secure connections. For this reason, you should always support HTTPS for any web application that you build.
You can obtain, and renew, a web certificate by enabling the ACME protocol for your web server and communicating with Let's Encrypt to generate the needed certificates. This is not difficult to do, and many languages such as Rust, Node.js, or Go support this functionality by simply including an additional library.



## HTML/ Hypertext markup language
- Every element in html has a tag that represents the element.
- Every Html element also has attributes.
- **Attributes?** Describe the specific details of the element. Examples:
  - id : Which is an attribute that gives a unique id to the element to distinguish it from other elements.
  - class : this attribute classifies the element into a named group of elements.
- Attributes are written inside element tag with a name followed by an optional value. EX:
```
<p id="hello" class="greeting">Hello world</p>
```
- **Hyperlinks:** A hyperlink in html is represented by an anchor (a) element that has an attribute containing the address of the hyperlink reference (href). Example:
```
    -<a href="https://byu.edu">Go to the Y</a>
```
HTML defines a header (<!DOCTYPE html>) that tells the browser the type and version of the document. You should always include this at the top of the HTML file. We can now add the header, some attributes, and more content to our document for a full example.
```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <body>
    <main>
      <h1>Hello world</h1>
      <p class="introduction">
        HTML welcomes you to the amazing world of
        <span class="topic">web programming</span>.
      </p>
      <p class="question">What will this mean to you?</p>
      <p class="assignment">Learn more <a href="instruction.html">here</a>.</p>
    </main>
  </body>
</html>
```
- **NOTE:** By default a web server will display the HTML file named **index.html**. So it is very common to name the main HTML file for your web application **index.html**.

-**TABLES:** This is how you do it:
```
<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Company</th>
    <th>Contact</th>
    <th>Country</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Alfreds Futterkiste</td>
    <td>Maria Anders</td>
    <td>Germany</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Centro comercial Moctezuma</td>
    <td>Francisco Chang</td>
    <td>Mexico</td>
  </tr>
</table>
```
### External media:
- When ever using tags that reference external media you will always take a URL as an attribute with **src**.
  
-**Images:** When putting an image in html, you don't need and end </img>, you just need the attributes src= "URL" and alt = "name your image"
  - src - Specifies the path to the image
  - alt - Specifies an alternate text for the image (just so you know what the image is from code}
```
<img src="url" alt="alternatetext">
```
- But you can also use width and height attributes or just style attribute to edit it.
```
<img src="img_girl.jpg" alt="Girl in a jacket" width="500" height="600">
```
or
```
<img src="img_girl.jpg" alt="Girl in a jacket" style="width:500px;height:600px;">
```

-**Audio**:
  - When using the audio element specify url with src, then include controls attribute if you want user to control the audio playback. If you do not display the controls then there is no visual representation of the audio in the rendered page. The autoplay attribute starts the audio playing as soon as the audio file is loaded, and the loop attribute keeps it playing over and over.
```
<audio controls src="testAudio.mp3"></audio>
```

-**Video**: 
  - specify url with src.
  - like audio you can include the control, autoplay attributes.
  - *Note that you may need to include the crossorigin="anonymous" attribute if you are requesting files from a different domain than the one serving your content.*
```
<video controls width="300" crossorigin="anonymous">
  <source src="https://commondatastorage.googleapis.com/gtv-videos-bucket/sample/BigBuckBunny.mp4" />
</video>
```
Also: There is a github account with public videos to url from.

-**Internal Media**:
- The internal media elements svg and canvas allow you to actually create images directly within your HTML.
  - **SVG**: is an extremely powerful and widely supported way to render graphics inline in your HTML. An example SVG graphic that draws a black border and a red circle looks like this:
    ```
    <svg viewBox="0 0 300 200" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" stroke="red" fill="red" style="border: 1px solid #000000">
    <circle cx="150" cy="100" r="50" />
    </svg>
    ```
  - **Canvas**: element was introduced to HTML in order to facilitate 2D drawing and animation. The HTML for the canvas element is fairly simple, but actually drawing on the canvas requires JavaScript support. Here again, is our simple red dot example.
    ```
    <canvas id="canvasDemo" width="300" height="200" style="border: 1px solid #000000"></canvas>
    <script>
      const ctx = document.getElementById('canvasDemo').getContext('2d');
      ctx.beginPath();
      ctx.arc(150, 100, 50, 0, 2 * Math.PI);
      ctx.fillStyle = 'red';
      ctx.strokeStyle = 'red';
      ctx.fill();
      ctx.stroke();
    </script>
    ```

### Special characters:
HTML uses several reserved characters for defining its file format. If you want to use those characters in your content then you need to escape them using the entity syntax. For example, to display a less than symbol (<) you would instead use the less than entity (&lt;). You can also use the entity syntax to represent any unicode character.

|Character|	Entity|

### HTML Glossary:
|Element | Meaning     |
|------|-------------|
|html| top-level page structure, or page container|
|head| contains the metadata about the page and page title, or header information|
|title| title of page (found in title bar)|
|body| define the main content structure of a web page, including text, images, links, and other HTML elements|
|main| specifies the main content of a document|
|h1 - h6| H1 tags are used to indicate the primary topic of your webpage to visitors and search engines. HTML heading tags, H1 to H6, are used to format the text on a page with H1 defining the most important and visually prominent heading on the page.|
|form|The <form> tag in HTML is used to create form for user input. There are many elements which are used within form tag. For example: <input>, <textarea>, <button>, <select>, <option>, <optgroup>, <fieldset>, <label>. ... input: It is used to specify the input field for user.|
|fieldset|The <fieldset> tag is used to group related elements in a form. The <fieldset> tag draws a box around the related elements.|
|!DOCTYPE html| All html documents must start with this|
|html lang="en"|This represent root of HTML document. The container for all html elements. Always include html lang attribute inside html taf to declare language of web page. To assit search engines.|
|Metadata| Metadata is not displayed. Defines the document title,character set, style, and other meta info|
|meta charset=" UTF-8" | makes it possible to use emojis and other characters that aren't in the traditional ASCII character set on your webpage. If you don't use the tag, then you will need to look up HTML entities to manually insert an emoji or other character.|
|meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" |sets the initial zoom level when the page is first loaded by the browser|
|nav| The <nav> element in HTML is used to represent a section of a page that contains navigation links. These links can be to other pages or to different parts of the same page |
|attribute= placeholder| 



## CSS:
- With CSS a web programmer can animate the page, deploy custom fonts, respond to user actions, and dynamically alter the entire layout of the page based on the size of a device and its orientation.
- CSS is primarily concerned with defining rulesets, or simply rules. A rule is comprised of a selector that selects the elements to apply the rule to, and one or more declarations that represent the property to style with the given property value.
Example:
![cssDefinitions](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e57e1a40-91e9-4174-8656-e2e3476952c0)

```
p {
  font-family: sans-serif;
  font-size: 2em;
  color: navy;
  text-shadow: 3px 3px 1px #cccccc;
}
```
The selector p selects all paragraph elements in the HTML document. The four specified declarations then: 1) change the font to use a sans-serif font, 2) increase the font size to be twice as big as the default font, 3) change the text color to be navy, and 4) create a gray shadow for the text. The result looks like this.

![cssSimpleRule](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/321557b9-fe82-4080-90ca-4ec67f1a4def)


### 3 ways to use CSS with HTML
The first way is to use the style attribute of an HTML element and explicitly assign one or more declarations.
```
<p style="color:green">CSS</p>
```
The next way to associate CSS is to use the HTML style element to define CSS rules within the HTML document. The style element should appear in the head element of the document so that the rules apply to all elements of the document.
```
<head>
  <style>
    p {
      color: green;
    }
  </style>
</head>
<body>
  <p>CSS</p>
</body>
```
The final way to associate CSS is to use the HTML link element to create a hyperlink reference to an external file containing CSS rules. The link element must appear in the head element of the document.
```
<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css" />
```
styles.css
```
p {
  color: green;
}
```
All of the above examples are equivalent, but using the link element usually is the preferred way to define CSS.

### The box model:
CSS defines everything as boxes. When you apply styles, you are applying them to a region of the display that is a rectangular box. Within an element's box there are several internal boxes. 

- Content is inside:  This is where things like the text or image of an element is displayed
- Then padding: The padding will inherit things like the background color
- After padding is border:which has properties like color, thickness and line style.
- Final box is margin:The margin is considered external to the actual styling of the box and therefore only represents whitespace.

![cssBoxModel](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dec87aed-0604-4406-baa2-249ec9156705)

The width and height of an element is defined by the width and height of the content box.
You can change the box-sizing CSS property from the default value of content-box to border-box in order to redefine the width and height to also include the padding and the border. 

### CSS Selectors:
Example: This is the html code: 
```
<body>
  <h1>Departments</h1>
  <p>welcome message</p>
  <section id="physics">
    <h2>Physics</h2>
    <p class="introduction">Introduction</p>
    <p>Text</p>
    <p class="summary">Summary</p>
  </section>
  <section id="chemistry">
    <h2>Chemistry</h2>
    <p class="introduction">Introduction</p>
    <p>Text</p>
    <p class="summary">Summary</p>
  </section>
</body>
```
- In the html code, you can give certain aspects of your code classes. Like introduction and summary.
- Then in CSS, you can specifically edit those classes by just calling them out using a period.
  ```
  .introduction {  }
  ```
- You can do the same to call specifc id's, using a hastag.
  ```
  #physics {  }
  ```
- You can do **Attributes**:
Attribute selectors allow you to select elements based upon their attributes. You use an attribute selector to select any element with a given attribute (a[href]). You can also specify a required value for an attribute (a[href="./fish.png"]) in order for the selector to match. Attribute selectors also support wildcards such as the ability to select attribute values containing specific text (p[href*="https://"]).
```
p[class='summary'] {
  color: red;
}
```

- **Hover** highlight bar.
- And you can do something called psuedo selector. Suppose we want our purple highlight bar to appear only when the mouse hovers over the text. To accomplish this we can change our ID selector to select whenever a section is hovered over.
  ```
  section:hover {  }
  ```
This is [CodePen](https://codepen.io/leesjensen/pen/NWzByav) to look into it more.

### Combinators:
We want to change the color of the second level headings (h2), but we only want to do that within the sections for each department. To make that happen we can provide a descendant combinator that is defined with a space delimited list of values where each item in the list is a descendant of the previous item. So our selector would be all h2 elements that are descendants of section elements.
```
section h2 {
  color: #004400;
}
```
There are other types of combinators that you can use. These include the following.

|Combinator|	Meaning|	Example|	Description|
|----------|---------|---------|-------------|
|Descendant	|A list of descendants	|body section	|Any section that is a descendant of a body|
|Child	|A list of direct children	|section > p |Any p that is a direct child of a section|
|General sibling	|A list of siblings|	div ~ p	|Any p that has a div sibling|
|Adjacent sibling	|A list of adjacent sibling|	div + p	|Any p that has an adjacent div sibling|

You can also combine the element name and class selectors to select all paragraphs with a class of summary.
```
p.summary {
  font-weight: bold;
}
```

### CSS Declerations:
- Basically, the thingns you can say, units you can use, and ways to say color.

**List of declerations**
|Property|	Value|	Example|	Discussion|
|--------|-------|---------|------------|
|background-color|	color|	red|	Fill the background color|
|border|	color width style|	#fad solid medium|	Sets the border using shorthand where any or all of the values may be provided|
|border-radius|	unit|	50%|	The size of the border radius|

|columns|	number|	3|	Number of textual columns|
|column-rule|	color width style|	solid thin black|	Sets the border used between columns using border shorthand|
|color	color	rgb(128, 0, 0)	Sets the text color

|max-[width/height]	unit	20%	Restricts the width or height to no more than the unit
|min-[width/height]	unit	10vh	Restricts the width or height to no less than the unit
|opacity	number	.9	Sets how opaque the element is
|overflow	[visible/hidden/scroll/auto]	scroll	Defines what happens when the content does not fix in its |box

|padding	unit	1em 2em	Sets the padding spacing
|left	unit	10rem	The horizontal value of a positioned element
|text-align	[start/end/center/justify]	end	Defines how the text is aligned in the element
|top	unit	50px	The vertical value of a positioned element
|transform	transform-function	rotate(0.5turn)	Applies a transformation to the element
|width	unit	25vmin	Sets the width of the box
|z-index	number	100	Controls the positioning of the element on the z axis


**Units:**
Unit	Description
px	The number of pixels
pt	The number of points (1/72 of an inch)
in	The number of inches
cm	The number of centimeters
%	A percentage of the parent element
em	A multiplier of the width of the letter m in the parent's font
rem	A multiplier of the width of the letter m in the root's font
ex	A multiplier of the height of the element's font
vw	A percentage of the viewport's width
vh	A percentage of the viewport's height
vmin	A percentage of the viewport's smaller dimension
vmax	A percentage of the viewport's larger dimension


This [Codepen](https://codepen.io/leesjensen/pen/rNKrgKQ) demonstrates the use of many of the above declarations. Take some time to experiment with it. Make sure you try modifying different selectors and declarations. Try different unit representations.

### CSS Fonts:
- There are four major families of fonts: Serif, sans-serif, fixed, and symbol.
- However, you can import fonts using the @font-face rule and by providing the font name and source location.
  ```
  @font-face {
  font-family: 'Quicksand';
  src: url('https://cs260.click/fonts/quicksand.ttf');
  }

  p {
    font-family: Quicksand;
  }
  ```
- If you don't want to do that you can get it from provider like google who have a large selection of open source fonts that you can use without paying any royalties. The easiest way to use Google fonts is to use a CSS import statement to reference the Google Font Service. This will automatically generate the CSS for importing the font.
  ```
  @import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Rubik Microbe&display=swap');

  p {
    font-family: 'Rubik Microbe';
  }
  ```

[CodePen](https://codepen.io/leesjensen/pen/zYaLgVW)

### CSS Animations:
-  You create CSS animations using the animation properties and defining keyframes for what the element should look like at different times in the animation.
Ex:
- We have a paragraph of centered text and we want it to zoom in until its size is 20% of the view height.
  ```
  p {
    text-align: center;
    font-size: 20vh;
  }
  ```
- Then we select the elements by adding the animation-name property with a value of demo. This name refers to the name of the keyframes that we will specify in a minute. The keyframes tell what CSS properites should be applied at different key points in the animation sequence.
-  We also add an animation-duration property in order to specify that the animation should last for three seconds.
  ```
  p {
    text-align: center;
    font-size: 20vh;
  
    animation-name: demo;
    animation-duration: 3s;
  }
  ```
- Now we are ready to create the keyframes. We need define the key points, and CSS will generate a smooth transition to move from one keyframe to another.
- So if we want to start with text that is invisible and have it zoom into the full final size. We can do this with two frames that are designated with the keywords from and to.
  ```
  @keyframes demo {
    from {
      font-size: 0vh;
    }
  
    to {
      font-size: 20vh;
    }
  }
  ```
- It would look better if towards the end, the paragraph bounced out a little bigger than its final size. We can accommodate that by adding another key frame that happens 95 percent through the animation.
  ```
  @keyframes demo {
    from {
      font-size: 0vh;
    }
  
    95% {
      font-size: 21vh;
    }
  
    to {
      font-size: 20vh;
    }
  }
  ```

### Responsive Design:
-  This ability to reconfigure the interface so the application accommodates and takes advantage of the screen's size and orientation is called responsive design

|Value|	Meaning|
|-----|--------|
|none|	Don't display this element. The element still exists, but the browser will not render it.|
|block|	Display this element with a width that fills its parent element. A p or div element has block display by default.|
|inline|	Display this element with a width that is only as big as its content. A b or span element has inline display by default.|
|flex	|Display this element's children in a flexible orientation.|
|grid	|Display this element's children in a grid orientation.|

We can demonstrate the different CSS display property values with the following HTML that contains a bunch of div elements. By default div elements have a display property value of block.
```
<div class="none">None</div>
<div class="block">Block</div>
<div class="inline">Inline1</div>
<div class="inline">Inline2</div>
<div class="flex">
  <div>FlexA</div>
  <div>FlexB</div>
  <div>FlexC</div>
  <div>FlexD</div>
</div>
<div class="grid">
  <div>GridA</div>
  <div>GridB</div>
  <div>GridC</div>
  <div>GridD</div>
</div>
```
default of above.
![cssDisplayDefault](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f0c32eff-f793-4509-9dff-d4bcced4da54)

If we modify the display property associated with each element with the following CSS, then we get a totally different rendering.
```
.none {
  display: none;
}

.block {
  display: block;
}

.inline {
  display: inline;
}

.flex {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: row;
}

.grid {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr;
}
```
![cssDisplay](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2cce3afb-eb4b-4fdb-abb2-c64c3449a6bf)

- include a meta tag in the head element of all your HTML pages. This tells the browser to not scale the page. So that you can look at it with phone and laptop.
  ```
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width,initial-scale=1" />
  ```
  
**Float:**
- The float css property moves an element to the left or right of its container element and allows inline elements to wrap around it. For example, if we had an aside element followed by a large paragraph of text, we could create the following CSS rule in order to cause the text to wrap around the aside.
  ```
  aside {
    float: right;
    padding: 3em;
    margin: 0.5em;
    border: black solid thin;
  }
  ```
![cssFloat](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f75302ca-3e05-4d51-a604-f1945d7a46fa)

- When the browser resizes, the text will flow around the floating element. You can use this CodePen to experiment with float. Try changing the descriptor value to none or left and see what happens.


- One of the main CSS features for creating responsive applications is the @media selector. This selector dynamically detects the size and orientation of the device and applies CSS rules to represent the structure of the HTML in a way that accommodates the change.
- We can use the @media selector to tell us which side of the screen (technically the viewport) is the longest. A media query takes one or more predicates separated by boolean operators. In our case we simply want to know if the screen is oriented in portrait mode (short side on top) or not. If it is then we transform all of our div elements by rotating them 270 degrees.
  ```
  @media (orientation: portrait) {
    div {
      transform: rotate(270deg);
    }
  }
  ```
- You can also use media queries to make entire pieces of your application disappear, or move to a different location. For example, if we had an aside that was helpful when the screen is wide, but took up too much room when the screen got narrow, we could use the following media query to make it disappear.
  ```
  @media (orientation: portrait) {
    aside {
      display: none;
    }
  }
  ```

### Grid:
- The grid display layout is useful when you want to display a group of child elements in a responsive grid. We start with a container element that has a bunch of child elements.
  ```
  <div class="container">
    <div class="card"></div>
    <div class="card"></div>
    <div class="card"></div>
    <div class="card"></div>
    <div class="card"></div>
    <div class="card"></div>
    <div class="card"></div>
    <div class="card"></div>
    <div class="card"></div>
  </div>
  ```
We turn this into a responsive grid by including a CSS display property with the value of grid on the container element. This tells the browser that all of the children of this element are to be displayed in a grid flow. The grid-template-columns property specifies the layout of the grid columns. We set this to repeatedly define each column to auto-fill the parent element's width with children that are resized to a minimum of 300 pixels and a maximum of one equal fractional unit (1fr) of the parents total width. A fractional unit is dynamically computed by splitting up the parent element's width into equal parts. Next, we fix the height of the rows to be exactly 300 pixels by specifying the grid-auto-rows property. Finally, we finish off the grid configuration by setting the grid-gap property to have a gap of at least 1 em between each grid item.
  ```
  .container {
    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fill, minmax(300px, 1fr));
    grid-auto-rows: 300px;
    grid-gap: 1em;
  }
  ```
![cssGrid](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/23176d90-03f2-4a32-9bce-d237fa6ba003)

### Flexbox:
- The flex display layout is useful when you want to partition your application into areas that responsively move around as the window resizes or the orientation changes.

justify-content: center; this centers content in relation to what is the box it is in. SO its not just centerd at the top of the box but in the middle of the entire box it is in.
flex: 1; this makes sure the page can expand or grow. If you don't have your main part of your page set to that then it will always stay small.
Also, need to have the html set to 100% so it can grow that length.

So we can visualize our design by quickly sketching it out.

![cssAppMock](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f823a281-1c65-4867-844c-3687692abe21)

Next we build our structural HTML to match our design.
```
<body>
  <header>
    <h1>CSS flex &amp; media query</h1>
  </header>
  <main>
    <section>
      <h2>Controls</h2>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Content</h2>
    </section>
  </main>
  <footer>
    <h2>Footer</h2>
  </footer>
</body>
```

Now we can use Flexbox to make it all come alive. We make the body element into a responsive flexbox by including the CSS display property with the value of flex. This tells the browser that all of the children of this element are to be displayed in a flex flow. We want our top level flexbox children to be column oriented and so we add the flex-direction property with a value of column. We then add some simple other declarations to zero out the margin and fill the entire viewport with our application frame.

body {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  margin: 0;
  height: 100vh;
}
To get the division of space for the flexbox children correct we add the following flex properties to each of the children.

header - flex: 0 80px - Zero means it will not grow and 80px means it has a starting basis height of 80 pixels. This creates a fixed size box.
footer - flex: 0 30px - Like the header it will not grow and has a height of 30 pixels.
main - flex: 1 - One means it will get one fractional unit of growth, and since it is the only child with a non-zero growth value, it will get all the remaining space. Main also gets some additional properties because we want it to also be a flexbox container for the controls and content area. So we set its display to be flex and specify the flex-direction to be row so that the children are oriented side by side.
```
header {
  flex: 0 80px;
  background: hsl(223, 57%, 38%);
}

footer {
  flex: 0 30px;
  background: hsl(180, 10%, 10%);
}

main {
  flex: 1;
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: row;
}
```
Now we just need to add CSS to the control and content areas represented by the two child section elements. We want the controls to have 25% of the space and the content to have the remaining. So we set the flex property value to 1 and 3 respectively. That means that the controls get one unit of space and the content gets three units of space. No matter how we resize things this ratio will responsively remain.
```
section:nth-child(1) {
  flex: 1;
  background-color: hsl(180, 10%, 80%);
}
section:nth-child(2) {
  flex: 3;
  background-color: white;
}
```
Media Query
That completes our original design, but we also want to handle small screen sizes. To do this, we add some media queries that drop the header and footer if the viewport gets too short, and orient the main sections as rows if it gets too narrow.

To support the narrow screen (portrait mode), we include a media query that detects when we are in portrait orientation and sets the flex-direction of the main element to be column instead of row. This causes the children to be stacked on top of each other instead of side by side.

To handle making our header and footer disappear when the screen is to short to display them, we use a media query that triggers when our viewport height has a maximum value of 700 pixels. When that is true we change the display property for both the header and the footer to none so that they will be hidden. When that happens the main element becomes the only child and since it has a flex value of 1, it takes over everything.
```
@media (orientation: portrait) {
  main {
    flex-direction: column;
  }
}

@media (max-height: 700px) {
  header {
    display: none;
  }
  footer {
    display: none;
  }
}
```
Here is what the finished application looks like.

![cssFlex](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/13415d3a-90e7-4291-a45d-0b210b1687e1)


### Debugging in CSS:
Open the directory with VS Code and use the Live Server extension to view the HTML in the Chrome browser. In the browser, right click on the text and select inspect. This will open the debugger window and display the Elements tab. As you move your cursor over the different elements you will visually see what the padding, borders, and margins are set to. The Styles pane shows all of the CSS properties applied to the currently selected element. If you scroll down to the bottom of the styles pane you will see the CSS box. By moving the cursor over the different parts of the CSS box it will highlight the different box parts in the browser window.

![debugCssBrowser](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b206154e-5b6e-4c72-9010-e56dc69be4d3)

You can change any of the CSS properties, and even add new properties, directly in the debugger. This allows you to see what each property is contributing and change them to see how that impacts the rendering. This is a great way to figure out what CSS works best without having to continually change the CSS file and refresh the browser.

Basically using the inspector tool. You can directly edit it in the debugger.

### CSS Frameworks:
CSS frameworks provide functions and components that commonly appear in web applications. As web developers built more and more web applications they began to use the same patterns over and over. They combined these patterns into a shared package of code and contributed it to the world as open source repositories. This helped not only decrease the time to develop an application, but created a common user experience for the web in general.

**Tailwind**:
A new rising contender in the CSS framework space is Tailwind CSS and its associated component library Tailwind UI. In the 2022 StateOfCSS poll, Tailwind gained an impressive 46% general usage ranking with a retention rating of 78%, all within the last four years.

Tailwind takes a different approach than traditional CSS frameworks. Instead of using large, rich, CSS rulesets to compartmentalize styling and functionality, it uses smaller definitions that are applied specifically to individual HTML elements. This moves much of the CSS representation out of the CSS file and directly into the HTML.
```
<div class="pt-6 md:p-8 text-center md:text-left space-y-4">
  <img class="w-24 h-24 md:w-48 md:h-auto md:rounded-none rounded-full mx-auto" src="profile.png" />
  <p class="text-lg font-medium">“Tailwind CSS”</p>
</div>
```

**Bootstrap:**
The reigning champion for CSS frameworks is Bootstrap. Bootstrap has been supported by an active and vibrant community for over a decade and contains many lessons learned from real world applications. The major downside of Bootstrap is its own success. Because it is so popular, Bootstrap defines the de facto look and feel of websites. This is great for user experience continuity, but it makes it difficult for a website to grab the attention of new users.

Getting bootstrap
You can integrate Bootstrap into your web applications simply by referencing the Bootstrap CSS files from their content delivery network (CDN). You then add the HTML link elements to your head element like this.
```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1" />
    <link
      href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css"
      rel="stylesheet"
      integrity="sha384-rbsA2VBKQhggwzxH7pPCaAqO46MgnOM80zW1RWuH61DGLwZJEdK2Kadq2F9CUG65"
      crossorigin="anonymous"
    />
  </head>
  <body>
    ...
  </body>
</html>
```
If you are going to use Bootstrap components that require JavaScript (carousel, buttons, and more), you will also need to include Bootstrap's JavaScript module. You add this by putting the following at the end of your HTML body element.
```
<body>
  ...

  <script
    src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js"
    integrity="sha384-kenU1KFdBIe4zVF0s0G1M5b4hcpxyD9F7jL+jjXkk+Q2h455rYXK/7HAuoJl+0I4"
    crossorigin="anonymous"
  ></script>
</body>
```
You don't need to worry about this now, but later on, when we introduce the downloading of JavaScript packages, you can use the Node Package Manager (NPM) to download Bootstrap and include it in your source code. That way you don't have to rely on someone else's server to provide you with a vital piece of your application. For future reference, to include Bootstrap in your application using NPM you would run the following from your console.
```
npm install bootstrap@5.2.3
```

1. Create a new index.html file in your project root. Include the <meta name="viewport"> tag as well for proper responsive behavior in mobile devices.
```
<!doctype html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
    <title>Bootstrap demo</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
  </body>
</html>
```
2. Include Bootstrap’s CSS and JS. Place the <link> tag in the <head> for our CSS, and the <script> tag for our JavaScript bundle (including Popper for positioning dropdowns, poppers, and tooltips) before the closing </body>. Learn more about our CDN links.

```
<!doctype html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
    <title>Bootstrap demo</title>
    <link href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css" rel="stylesheet" integrity="sha384-rbsA2VBKQhggwzxH7pPCaAqO46MgnOM80zW1RWuH61DGLwZJEdK2Kadq2F9CUG65" crossorigin="anonymous">
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
    <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js" integrity="sha384-kenU1KFdBIe4zVF0s0G1M5b4hcpxyD9F7jL+jjXkk+Q2h455rYXK/7HAuoJl+0I4" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```
You can also include Popper and our JS separately. If you don’t plan to use dropdowns, popovers, or tooltips, save some kilobytes by not including Popper.

```
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@popperjs/core@2.11.6/dist/umd/popper.min.js" integrity="sha384-oBqDVmMz9ATKxIep9tiCxS/Z9fNfEXiDAYTujMAeBAsjFuCZSmKbSSUnQlmh/jp3" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.min.js" integrity="sha384-cuYeSxntonz0PPNlHhBs68uyIAVpIIOZZ5JqeqvYYIcEL727kskC66kF92t6Xl2V" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
```
Hello, world! Open the page in your browser of choice to see your Bootstrapped page. Now you can start building with Bootstrap by creating your own layout, adding dozens of components, and utilizing our official examples.


## CSS GLossary:
|Element | Meaning     |
|------|-------------|
|*| This selects all the HTML elements on the page.|
|body| elements surrounds all of a page's content that will actually be rendereed on the web page|
|padding| used to create space around an element's content, inside of any defined borders.|
|padding: lem| This applies to all 4 sides.|
|font-weight| changes how bulky the font looks, how bold it is in a way.|
|td|used for table data cells|
|th|used for table header cells|


# JavaScript:

To output: 
```
console.log('Hello' + ' ' + 'world');
// OUTPUT: Hello world
```
To create a function:
```
function join(a, b) {
  return a + ' ' + b;
}
```
NOTE: Use your browser's debugger. For example, if you open Chrome and press F12 the debugger will display. Select the Console menu option. This will display a JavaScript interpreter where you can write and execute your code.

The basic usage of the console object is to output a log message.
```
console.log('hello');
// OUTPUT: hello
```
You can create formatted messages in the log parameter.
```
console.log('hello %s', 'world');
// OUTPUT: hello world
```
You can even specify CSS declarations in order to style the log output.
```
console.log('%c JavaScript Demo', 'font-size:1.5em; color:green;');
// OUTPUT: JavaScript Demo //in large green text
```
- Timers
If you are trying to see how long a piece of code is running you can wrap it with time and timeEnd calls and it will output the duration between the time and timeEnd calls.
```
console.time('demo time');
// ... some code that takes a long time.
console.timeEnd('demo time');
// OUTPUT: demo time: 9762.74 ms
```
- Count
To see how many times a block of code is called you can use the count function.
```
console.count('a');
// OUTPUT: a: 1
console.count('a');
// OUTPUT: a: 2
console.count('b');
// OUTPUT: b: 1
```
#### Adding JavaScript to HTML:
- You can insert JavaScript into HTML either by directly including it in the HTML within the content of a <script> element, or by using the src attribute of the script element to reference an external JavaScript file.
  
index.js
```
function sayHello() {
  console.log('hello');
}
```
index.html
```
<head>
  <script src="javascript.js"></script>
</head>
<body>
  <button onclick="sayHello()">Say Hello</button>
  <button onclick="sayGoodbye()">Say Goodbye</button>
  <script>
    function sayGoodbye() {
      alert('Goodbye');
    }
  </script>
</body>
```
Notice that we call the sayHello and sayGoodbye JavaScript functions from the HTML in the onclick attribute of the button element. Special attributes like onclick automatically create event listeners for different DOM events that call the code contained in the attribute's value. The code specified by the attribute value can be a simple call to a function or any JavaScript code.
```
<button onclick="let i=1;i++;console.log(i)">press me</button>
<!-- OUTPUT: 2 -->
```

#### JavaScript type and construct:

- Variables are declared using either the let or const keyword. let allows you to change the value of the variable while const will cause an error if you attempt to change it.
```
let x = 1;

const y = 2;
```
Type:

|Type|	Meaning|
|----|---------|
|Null|	The type of a variable that has not been assigned a value.|
|Undefined|	The type of a variable that has not been defined.|
|Boolean|	true or false.|
|Number|	A 64-bit signed number.|
|BigInt|	A number of arbitrary magnitude.|
|String|	A textual sequence of characters.|
|Symbol|	A unique value.|

NOte: You assign a null to a variable if you want it to be not assigned anything. Like setting character color o null if not selected anything, etc.

Type	Use	Example
Object	A collection of properties represented by name-value pairs. Values can be of any type.	{a:3, b:'fish'}
Function	An object that has the ability to be called.	function a() {}
Date	Calendar dates and times.	new Date('1995-12-17')
Array	An ordered sequence of any type.	[3, 'fish']
Map	A collection of key-value pairs that support efficient lookups.	new Map()
JSON	A lightweight data-interchange format used to share information across programs.	{"a":3, "b":"fish"}

Common Operations:
When dealing with a number variable, JavaScript supports standard mathematical operators like + (add), - (subtract), * (multiply), / (divide), and === (equality). For string variables, JavaScript supports + (concatenation) and === (equality).

Type conversions
JavaScript is a weakly typed language. That means that a variable always has a type, but the variable can change type when it is assigned a new value, or that types can be automatically converted based upon the context that they are used in. Sometimes the results of automatic conversions can be unexpected from programmers who are used to strongly typed languages. Consider the following examples.
```
2 + '3';
// OUTPUT: '23'
2 * '3';
// OUTPUT: 6
[2] + [3];
// OUTPUT: '23'
true + null;
// OUTPUT: 1
true + undefined;
// OUTPUT: NaN
```
Getting unexpected results is especially common when dealing with the equality operator.
```
1 == '1';
// OUTPUT: true
null == undefined;
// OUTPUT: true
'' == false;
// OUTPUT: true
```
⚠ The unexpected results happen in JavaScript because it uses complex rules for defining equality that depend upon the conversion of a type to a boolean value. You will sometimes hear this referred to as falsy and truthy evaluations. To remove this confusion, JavaScript introduced the strict equality (===) and inequality (!==) operators. The strict operators skip the type conversion when computing equality. This results in the following.
```
1 === '1';
// OUTPUT: false
null === undefined;
// OUTPUT: false
'' === false;
// OUTPUT: false
```
Because strict equality is considered more intuitive, it is almost always preferred and should be used in your code.

Here is a fun example of JavaScript's type conversion. Execute the following in the browser's debugger console.
```
('b' + 'a' + +'a' + 'a').toLowerCase();
```
Conditionals
JavaScript supports many common programming language conditional constructs. This includes if, else, and if else. Here are some examples.
```
if (a === 1) {
  //...
} else if (b === 2) {
  //...
} else {
  //...
}
```
You can also use the ternary operator. This provides a compact if else representation.
```
a === 1 ? console.log(1) : console.log('not 1');
```
You can use boolean operations in the expression to create complex predicates. Common boolean operators include && (and), || (or), and ! (not).
```
if (true && (!false || true)) {
  //...
}
```
Loops
JavaScript supports many common programming language looping constructs. This includes for, for in, for of, while, do while, and switch. Here are some examples.

for
Note the introduction of the common post increment operation (i++) for adding one to a number.
```
for (let i = 0; i < 2; i++) {
  console.log(i);
}
// OUTPUT: 0 1
```
do while
```
let i = 0;
do {
  console.log(i);
  i++;
} while (i < 2);
// OUTPUT: 0 1
```
while
```
let i = 0;
while (i < 2) {
  console.log(i);
  i++;
}
// OUTPUT: 0 1
```
for in
The for in statement iterates over an object's property names.
```
const obj = { a: 1, b: 'fish' };
for (const name in obj) {
  console.log(name);
}
// OUTPUT: a
// OUTPUT: b
```
For arrays the object's name is the array index.
```
const arr = ['a', 'b'];
for (const name in arr) {
  console.log(name);
}
// OUTPUT: 0
// OUTPUT: 1
```
for of
The for of statement iterates over an iterable's (Array, Map, Set, ...) property values.
```
const arr = ['a', 'b'];
for (const val of arr) {
  console.log(val);
}
// OUTPUT: 'a'
// OUTPUT: 'b'
```
Break and continue
All of the looping constructs demonstrated above allow for either a break or continue statement to abort or advance the loop.
```
let i = 0;
while (true) {
  console.log(i);
  if (i === 0) {
    i++;
    continue;
  } else {
    break;
  }
}
// OUTPUT: 0 1
```

#### JavaScript String:

Strings are a primitive type in JavaScript. A string variable is specified by surrounding a sequence of characters with single quotes ('), double quotes ("), or backticks (`). The meaning of single or double quotes are equivalent, but the backtick defines a string literal that may contain JavaScript that is evaluated in place and concatenated into the string. A string literal replacement specifier is declared with a dollar sign followed by a curly brace pair. Anything inside the curly braces is evaluated as JavaScript. You can also use backticks to create multiline strings without having to explicitly escape the newline characters using \n.
```
'quoted text'; // " also works

const l = 'literal';
console.log(`string ${l + (1 + 1)} text`);
// OUTPUT: string literal2 text
```
Unicode support
JavaScript supports Unicode by defining a string as a sequence of 16-bit unsigned integers that represent UTF-16-encoded characters. Unicode support allows JavaScript to represent most languages spoken on the planet. This includes those that are read from right to left.
```
حجر
أقول لهذا الحجر: أنا أنت. فيقول: لستَ مرناً الى هذا الحدّ. أقول: قلبي مثلك؟ فيقول:
```
However, there are several important steps you must take in order to make your web application fully internationalized. This includes handling of currency, time, dates, iconography, units of measure, keyboard layouts, and respecting local customs. Read this article on the W3C website to learn more about internationalization.

String functions
The string object has several interesting functions associated with it. Here are some of the commonly used ones.

|Function	|Meaning|
|---------|-------|
|length	|The number of characters in the string|
|indexOf()	|The starting index of a given substring|
|split()	|Split the string into an array on the given delimiter string|
|startsWith()	|True if the string has a given prefix|
|endsWith()	|True if the string has a given suffix|
|toLowerCase()	|Converts all characters to lowercase|

```
const s = 'Example:조선글';

console.log(s.length);
// OUTPUT: 11
console.log(s.indexOf('조선글'));
// OUTPUT: 8
console.log(s.split(':'));
// OUTPUT: ['Example', '조선글']
console.log(s.startsWith('Ex'));
// OUTPUT: true
console.log(s.endsWith('조선글'));
// OUTPUT: true
console.log(s.toLowerCase());
// OUTPUT: example:조선글
```
#### Functions:
In JavaScript functions are first class objects. That means that they can be assigned a name, passed as a parameter, returned as a result, and referenced from an object or array just like any other variable.

The basic syntax of a function begins with the function keyword followed by zero or more parameters and a body that may contain zero or more return statements. The return statement may return a single value. Note that there are no type declarations, as the type is always inferred by the assignment of the value to the parameter.
```
function hello(who) {
  return 'hello ' + who;
}

console.log(hello('world'));
// OUTPUT: hello world
```
A function without a return value usually exists to produce some side effect like modifying a parameter or interacting with an external program. In the following example the side effect of the function is to output text to the debugger console.
```
function hello(who) {
  who.count++;
  console.log('hello ' + who.name);
}

hello({ name: 'world', count: 0 });
// OUTPUT: hello world
```
Function parameters
When a function is called, the caller may choose what parameters to provide. If a parameter is not provided then the value of the parameter is undefined when the function executes.

In addition to explicitly passing the value of a parameter to a function, the function can define a default value. This is done by assigning a value to the parameter in the function declaration.
```
function labeler(value, title = 'title') {
  console.log(`${title}=${value}`);
}

labeler();
// OUTPUT: title=undefined

labeler('fish');
// OUTPUT: title=fish

labeler('fish', 'animal');
// OUTPUT: animal=fish
```
Anonymous functions
Functions in JavaScript are commonly assigned to a variable so that they can be passed as a parameter to some other function or stored as an object property. To easily support this common use you can define a function anonymously and assign it to a variable.
```
// Function that takes a function as a parameter
function doMath(operation, a, b) {
  return operation(a, b);
}

// Anonymous function assigned to a variable
const add = function (a, b) {
  return a + b;
};

console.log(doMath(add, 5, 3));
// OUTPUT: 8

// Anonymous function assigned to a parameter
console.log(
  doMath(
    function (a, b) {
      return a - b;
    },
    5,
    3
  )
);
// OUTPUT: 2
```
Creating, passing, and returning functions
Here are examples of assigning functions to variables, as well as using functions as parameters and return values.
```
// Anonymous declaration of the function that is later assigned to a variable
const add = function (a, b) {
  return a + b;
};

// Function that logs as a side effect of its execution
function labeler(label, value) {
  console.log(label + '=' + value);
}

// Function that takes a function as a parameter and then executes the function as a side effect
function addAndLabel(labeler, label, adder, a, b) {
  labeler(label, adder(a, b));
}

// Passing a function to a function
addAndLabel(labeler, 'a+b', add, 1, 3);
// OUTPUT: a+b=4

// Function that returns a function
function labelMaker(label) {
  return function (value) {
    console.log(label + '=' + value);
  };
}

// Assign a function from the return value of the function
const nameLabeler = labelMaker('name');

// Calling the returned function
nameLabeler('value');
// OUTPUT: name=value
```
Inner functions
Functions can also be declared inside other functions. This allows you to modularize your code without always exposing private details.
```
function labeler(value) {
  function stringLabeler(value) {
    console.log('string=' + value);
  }
  function numberLabeler(value) {
    console.log('number=' + value);
  }

  if (typeof value == 'string') {
    stringLabeler(value);
  } else if (typeof value == 'number') {
    numberLabeler(value);
  }
}

labeler(5);
// OUTPUT: number=5

labeler('fish');
// OUTPUT: string=fish
```
#### JavaScript arrow function:
Because functions are first order objects in JavaScript they can be declared anywhere and passed as parameters. This results in code with lots of anonymous functions cluttering things up. To make the code more compact the arrow syntax was created. This syntax replaces the need for the function keyword with the symbols => placed after the parameter declaration. The enclosing curly braces are also optional.

This is a function in arrow syntax that takes no parameters and always returns 3.
```
() => 3;
```
The following two invocations of sort are equivalent.
```
const a = [1, 2, 3, 4];

// standard function syntax
a.sort(function (v1, v2) {
  return v1 - v2;
});

// arrow function syntax
a.sort((v1, v2) => v1 - v2);
```
Besides being compact, the arrow function syntax has some important semantic differences from the standard function syntax. This includes restrictions that arrow functions cannot be used for constructors or iterator generators.

Return values
Arrow functions also have special rules for the return keyword. The return keyword is optional if no curly braces are provided for the function and it contains a single expression. In that case the result of the expression is automatically returned. If curly braces are provided then the arrow function behaves just like a standard function.
```
() => 3;
// RETURNS: 3

() => {
  3;
};
// RETURNS: undefined

() => {
  return 3;
};
// RETURNS: 3
```
This pointer
Next, arrow functions inherit the this pointer from the scope in which they are created. This makes what is known as a closure. A closure allows a function to continue referencing its creation scope, even after it has passed out of that scope. This can be tricky to wrap your head around, and we discuss it in detail when we later talk about JavaScript scope. For now consider the following example.

The function makeClosure returns an anonymous function using the arrow syntax. Notice that the a parameter is overridden, a new b variable is created, and both a and b are referenced in the arrow function. Because of that reference, they are both part of the closure for the returned function.
```
function makeClosure(a) {
  a = 'a2';
  const b = 'b2';
  return () => [a, b];
}
```
Next, we declare the variables a and b at the top level scope, and call makeClosure with a.
```
const a = 'a';
const b = 'b';

const closure = makeClosure(a);
```
Now, when we call the closure function, it will output the values contained in the scope in which it was created, instead of the current values of the variables.
```
console.log(closure());
// OUTPUT: ['a2', 'b2']

console.log(a, b);
// OUTPUT: 'a' 'b'
```
Closures provide a valuable property when we do things like execute JavaScript within the scope of an HTML page, because it can remember the values of variables when the function was created instead of what they are when they are executed.

Putting it all together
Now that you know how functions work in JavaScript, let's look at an example that demonstrates the use of functions, arrow functions, parameters, a function as a parameter (callback), closures, and browser event listeners. This is done by implementing a debounce function.

The point of a debounce function is to only execute a specified function once within a given time window. Any requests to execute the debounce function more frequently than this will case the time window to reset. This is important in cases where a user can trigger expensive events thousands of times per second. Without a debounce the performance of your application can greatly suffer.

The following code calls the browser's window.addEventListener function to add a callback function that is invoked whenever the user scrolls the browser's web page. The first parameter to addEventListener specifies that it wants to listen for scroll events. The second parameter provides the function to call when a scroll event happens. In this case we call a function named debounce.

The debounce function takes two parameters, the time window for executing the window function, and the window function to call within that limit. In this case we will execute the arrow function at most every 500 milliseconds.
```
window.addEventListener(
  'scroll',
  debounce(500, () => {
    console.log('Executed an expensive calculation');
  })
);
```
The debounce function implements the execution of windowFunc within the restricted time window by creating a closure that contains the current timeout and returning a function that will reset the timeout every time it is called. The returned function is what the scroll event will actually call when the user scrolls the page. However, instead of directly executing the windowFunc it sets a timer based on the value of windowMs. If the debounce function is called again before the window times out then it resets the timeout.
```
function debounce(windowMs, windowFunc) {
  let timeout;
  return function () {
    console.log('scroll event');
    clearTimeout(timeout);
    timeout = setTimeout(() => windowFunc(), windowMs);
  };
}
```
You can experiment with this in CodePen. In this example, the background color will change as long as the user is scrolling. When they stop the background reverts back to white.


#### JavaScript Arrays:
JavaScript array objects represent a sequence of other objects and primitives. You can reference the members of the array using a zero based index. You can create an array with the Array constructor or using the array literal notation shown below.
```
const a = [1, 2, 3];
console.log(a[1]);
// OUTPUT: 2

console.log(a.length);
// OUTPUT: 3
```
Object functions
The Array object has several interesting static functions associated with it. Here are some of the interesting ones.

|Function|	Meaning|	Example|
|--------|---------|---------|
|push|	Add an item to the end of the array|	a.push(4)|
|pop|	Remove an item from the end of the array|	x = a.pop()|
|slice|	Return a sub-array|	a.slice(1,-1)|
|sort|	Run a function to sort an array in place|	a.sort((a,b) => b-a)|
|values|	Creates an iterator for use with a for of loop|	for (i of a.values()) {...}|
|find|	Find the first item satisfied by a test function|	a.find(i => i < 2)|
|forEach|	Run a function on each array item|	a.forEach(console.log)|
|reduce|	Run a function to reduce each array item to a single item|	a.reduce((a, c) => a + c)|
|map|	Run a function to map an array to a new array|	a.map(i => i+i)|
|filter|	Run a function to remove items|	a.filter(i => i%2)|
|every|	Run a function to test if all items match|	a.every(i => i < 3)|
|some|	Run a function to test if any items match|	a.some(i => i < 1)|
```
const a = [1, 2, 3];

console.log(a.map((i) => i + i));
// OUTPUT: [2,4,6]
console.log(a.reduce((v1, v2) => v1 + v2));
// OUTPUT: 6
console.log(a.sort((v1, v2) => v2 - v1));
// OUTPUT: [3,2,1]

a.push(4);
console.log(a.length);
// OUTPUT: 4
```
### JSON:
- JSON provides a simple way to share and store data. 
- By design JSON is easily convertible to, and from, JavaScript object
  
Type	Example
string	"crockford"
number	42
boolean	true
array	[null,42,"crockford"]
object	{"a":1,"b":"crockford"}
null	null

Most commonly, a JSON document contains an object. Objects contain zero or more key value pairs. The key is always a string, and the value must be one of the valid JSON data types. Key value pairs are delimited with commas. Curly braces delimit an object, square brackets and commas delimit arrays, and strings are always delimited with double quotes.

Here is an example of a JSON document.
```
{
  "class": {
    "title": "web programming",
    "description": "Amazing"
  },
  "enrollment": ["Marco", "Jana", "فَاطِمَة"],
  "start": "2025-02-01",
  "end": null
}
```
You can convert JSON to, and from, JavaScript using the JSON.parse and JSON.stringify functions.
```
const obj = { a: 2, b: 'crockford', c: undefined };
const json = JSON.stringify(obj);
const objFromJson = JSON.parse(json);

console.log(obj, json, objFromJson);

// OUTPUT:
// {a: 2, b: 'crockford', c: undefined}
// {"a":2, "b":"crockford"}
// {a: 2, b: 'crockford'}
```
Note that in this example, JSON cannot represent the JavaScript undefined object and so it gets dropped when converting from JavaScript to JSON.

### Javascript object and classes:
A JavaScript object represents a collection of name value pairs referred to as properties. The property name must be of type String or Symbol, but the value can be of any type. Objects also have common object-oriented functionality such as constructors, a this pointer, static properties and functions, and inheritance.

Objects can be created with the new operator. This causes the object's constructor to be called. Once declared you can add properties to the object by simply referencing the property name in an assignment. Any type of variable can be assigned to a property. This includes a sub-object, array, or function. The properties of an object can be referenced either with dot (obj.prop) or bracket notation (obj['prop']).

const obj = new Object({ a: 3 });
obj['b'] = 'fish';
obj.c = [1, 2, 3];
obj.hello = function () {
  console.log('hello');
};

console.log(obj);
// OUTPUT: {a: 3, b: 'fish', c: [1,2,3], hello: func}
The ability to dynamically modify an object is incredibly useful when manipulating data with an indeterminate structure.

⚠ Note the different uses of the term object. Object can refer to the standard JavaScript objects (e.g. Promise, Map, Object, Function, Date, ...), or it can refer specifically to the JavaScript Object object (i.e. new Object()), or it can refer to any JavaScript object you create (e.g. {a:'a', b:2} ). This overloaded usage can be a bit confusing.

Object-literals
You can also declare a variable of object type with the object-literal syntax. This syntax allows you to provide the initial composition of the object.

const obj = {
  a: 3,
  b: 'fish',
};
Object functions
Object has several interesting static functions associated with it. Here are some of the commonly used ones.

Function	Meaning
entries	Returns an array of key value pairs
keys	Returns an array of keys
values	Returns an array of values
const obj = {
  a: 3,
  b: 'fish',
};

console.log(Object.entries(obj));
// OUTPUT: [['a', 3], ['b', 'fish']]
console.log(Object.keys(obj));
// OUTPUT: ['a', 'b']
console.log(Object.values(obj));
// OUTPUT: [3, 'fish']
Constructor
Any function that returns an object is considered a constructor and can be invoked with the new operator.

function Person(name) {
  return {
    name: name,
  };
}

const p = new Person('Eich');
console.log(p);
// OUTPUT: {name: 'Eich'}
Because objects can have any type of property value you can create methods on the object as part of its encapsulation.

function Person(name) {
  return {
    name: name,
    log: function () {
      console.log('My name is ' + this.name);
    },
  };
}

const p = new Person('Eich');
p.log();
// OUTPUT: My name is Eich
This pointer
Notice in the last example the use of the keyword this when we referred to the name property (this.name). The meaning of this depends upon the scope of where it is used, but in the context of an object it refers to a pointer to the object. We will talk more about the this pointer in the instruction on scope.

Classes
You can use classes to define objects. Using a class clarifies the intent to create a reusable component rather than a one-off object. Class declarations look similar to declaring an object, but classes have an explicit constructor and assumed function declarations. The person object from above would look like the following when converted to a class.

class Person {
  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name;
  }

  log() {
    console.log('My name is ' + this.name);
  }
}

const p = new Person('Eich');
p.log();
// OUTPUT: My name is Eich
You can make properties and functions of classes private by prefixing them with a #.

class Person {
  #name;

  constructor(name) {
    this.#name = name;
  }
}

const p = new Person('Eich');
p.#name = 'Lie';
// OUTPUT: Uncaught SyntaxError: Private field '#name' must be declared in an enclosing class
Inheritance
Classes can be extended by using the extends keyword to define inheritance. Parameters that need to be passed to the parent class are delivered using the super function. Any functions defined on the child that have the same name as the parent override the parent's implementation. A parent's function can be explicitly accessed using the super keyword.

class Person {
  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name;
  }

  print() {
    return 'My name is ' + this.name;
  }
}

class Employee extends Person {
  constructor(name, position) {
    super(name);
    this.position = position;
  }

  print() {
    return super.print() + '. I am a ' + this.position;
  }
}

const e = new Employee('Eich', 'programmer');
console.log(e.print());
// OUTPUT: My name is Eich. I am a programmer

### JavaScript Regular expressions:
Regular expression support is built right into JavaScript. If you are not familiar with regular expressions, you can think of them as textual pattern matchers. You use a regular expression to find text in a string so that you can replace it, or simply to know that it exists.

You can create a regular expression using the class constructor or a regular expression literal.
```
const objRegex = new RegExp('ab*', 'i');
const literalRegex = /ab*/i;
```
The string class has several functions that accept regular expressions. This includes match, replace, search, and split. For a quick test to see if there is a match you can use the regular expression object's test function.
```
const petRegex = /(dog)|(cat)|(bird)/gim;
const text = 'Both cats and dogs are pets, but not rocks.';

text.match(petRegex);
// RETURNS: ['cat', 'dog']

text.replace(petRegex, 'animal');
// RETURNS: Both animals and animals are pets, but not rocks.

petRegex.test(text);
// RETURNS: true
```

### JavaScript rest and spread:
Sometimes you want a function to take an unknown number of parameters. For example, if you wanted to write a function that checks to see if some number in a list is equal to a given number, you could write this using an array.

function hasNumber(test, numbers) {
  return numbers.some((i) => i === test);
}

const a = [1, 2, 3];
hasNumber(2, a);
// RETURNS: true
However sometimes you don't have an array to work with. In this case you could create one on the fly.

function hasTwo(a, b, c) {
  return hasNumber(2, [a, b, c]);
}
But JavaScript provides the rest syntax to make this easier. Think of it as a parameter that contains the rest of the parameters. To turn the last parameter of any function into a rest parameter you prefix it with three periods. You can then call it with any number of parameters and they are all automatically combined into an array.

function hasNumber(test, ...numbers) {
  return numbers.some((i) => i === test);
}

hasNumber(2, 1, 2, 3);
// RETURNS: true
Note that you can only make the last parameter a rest parameter. Otherwise JavaScript would not know which parameters to combine into the array.

Technically speaking, rest allows JavaScript to provide what is called variadic functions.

Spread
Spread does the opposite of rest. It take an object that is iterable (e.g. array or string) and expands it into a function's parameters. Consider the following.

function person(firstName, lastName) {
  return { first: firstName, last: lastName };
}

const p = person(...['Ryan', 'Dahl']);
console.log(p);
// OUTPUT: {first: 'Ryan', last: 'Dahl'}

### javascript exceptions:
JavaScript supports exception handling using the try catch and throw syntax. An exception can be triggered whenever your code generates an exception using the throw keyword, or whenever an exception is generated by the JavaScript runtime, for example, when an undefined variable is used.

To catch a thrown exception, you wrap a code block with the try keyword, and follow the try block with a catch block. If within the try block, including any functions that block calls, an exception is thrown, then all of the code after the throw is ignored, the call stack is unwound, and the catch block is called.

In addition to a catch block, you can specify a finally block that is always called whenever the try block is exited regardless if an exception was ever thrown.

The basic syntax looks like the following.

try {
  // normal execution code
} catch (err) {
  // exception handling code
} finally {
  // always called code
}
For example:

function connectDatabase() {
  throw new Error('connection error');
}

try {
  connectDatabase();
  console.log('never executed');
} catch (err) {
  console.log(err);
} finally {
  console.log('always executed');
}

// OUTPUT: Error: connection error
//         always executed
⚠ When first using exception handling it is tempting to use it as way to handle normal flows of execution. For example, throwing a file not found exception when it is common for users to request nonexistent files. Throwing exceptions should only happen when something truly exceptional occurs. For example, a file not found exception when the file is required for your code to run, such as a required configuration file. Your code will be easier to debug, and your logs more meaningful if you restrict exceptions to truly exceptional situations.

Fallbacks
The fallback pattern is commonly implemented using exception handling. To implement the fallback pattern you put the normal feature path in a try block and then provide a fallback implementation in the catch block. For example, normally you would get the high scores for a game by making a network request, but if the network is not available then a locally cached version of the last available scores is used. By providing a fallback, you can always return something, even if the desired feature is temporarily unavailable.

function getScores() {
  try {
    const scores = scoringService.getScores();
    // store the scores so that we can use them later if the network is not available
    window.localStorage.setItem('scores', scores);
    return scores;
  } catch {
    return window.localStorage.getItem('scores');
  }
}


### Javascript destructing:
Destructuring, not to be confused with destructing, is the process of pulling individual items out of an existing one, or removing structure. You can do this with either arrays or objects. This is helpful when you only care about a few items in the original structure.

An example of destructuring arrays looks like the following.

const a = [1, 2, 4, 5];

// destructure the first two items from a, into the new variables b and c
const [b, c] = a;

console.log(b, c);
// OUTPUT: 1, 2
Note that even though it looks like you are declaring an array with the syntax on the left side of the expression, it is only specifying that you want to destructure those values out of the array.

You can also combine multiple items from the original object using rest syntax.

const [b, c, ...others] = a;

console.log(b, c, others);
// OUTPUT: 1, 2, [4,5]
This works in a similar manner for objects, except with arrays, the assignment of the associated value was assumed by the positions in the two arrays. When destructuring objects, you explicitly specify the properties you want to pull from the source object.

const o = { a: 1, b: 'animals', c: ['fish', 'cats'] };

const { a, c } = o;

console.log(a, c);
// OUTPUT 1, ['fish', 'cats']
You can also map the names to new variables instead of just using the original property names.

const o = { a: 1, b: 'animals', c: ['fish', 'cats'] };

const { a: count, b: type } = o;

console.log(count, type);
// OUTPUT 1, animals
Default values may also be provided for missing ones.

const { a, b = 22 } = {};
const [c = 44] = [];

console.log(a, b, c);
// OUTPUT: undefined, 22, 44
Note that all of the above examples created new constant variables, but you can also use destructuring to reassign existing variables.

let a = 22;

[a] = [1, 2, 3];

console.log(a);
// OUTPUT: 1


### Scope:
Understanding JavaScript scope is essential for making your programs run as you expect. Scope is defined as the variables that are visible in the current context of execution. JavaScript has four different types of scope:

Global - Visible to all code
Module - Visible to all code running in a module
Function - Visible within a function
Block - Visible within a block of code delimited by curly braces
Var
Initially JavaScript used the keyword var to declare a variable. The problem with var, unlike const or let, is that it ignores block scope. Variables declared with var are always logically hoisted to the top of the function. For example, the following code shows the same variable name being used within different enclosing scopes. However, because var ignores block scope the for loop is simply assigning a new value to x rather than declaring a new variable that has the same name.

var x = 10;
console.log('start', x);

for (var x = 0; x < 1; x++) {
  console.log('middle', x);
}

console.log('end', x);

// OUTPUT: start 10
//         middle 0
//         end 1
⚠ There are few cases where it makes sense to use var. It is strongly suggested that you only use const and let unless you fully understand why you are using var.

This
The keyword this represents a variable that points to an object that contains the context within the scope of the currently executing line of code. The this variable is automatically declared and you can reference this anywhere in a JavaScript program. Because the value of this depends upon the context in which it is referenced, there are three different contexts to which this can refer:

Global - When this is referenced outside a function or object it refers to the globalThis object. The globalThis object represents the context for runtime environment. For example, when running in a browser, globalThis refers to the browser's window object.
Function - When this is referenced in a function it refers to the object that owns the function. That is either an object you defined or globalThis if the function is defined outside of an object. Note that when running in JavaScript strict mode, a global function's this variable is undefined instead of globalThis.
Object - When this is referenced in an object it refers to the object.
'use strict';

// global scope
console.log('global:', this);
console.log('globalThis:', globalThis);

// function scope for a global function
function globalFunc() {
  console.log('globalFunctionThis:', this);
}
globalFunc();

// object scope
class ScopeTest {
  constructor() {
    console.log('objectThis:', this);
  }

  // function scope for an object function
  objectFunc() {
    console.log('objectFunctionThis:', this);
  }
}

new ScopeTest().objectFunc();
Running the above code in a browser results in the following.

global: Window
globalThis: Window
globalFunctionThis: undefined
objectThis: ScopeTest
objectFunctionThis: ScopeTest
Note that if we were not using JavaScript strict mode then globalFunctionThis would refer to Window.

Closure
A closure is defined as a function and its surrounding state. That means whatever variables are accessible when a function is created are available inside that function. This holds true even if you pass the function outside of the scope of its original creation.

Here is an example of a function that is created as part of an object. That means that function has access to the object's this pointer.

globalThis.x = 'global';

const obj = {
  x: 'object',
  f: function () {
    console.log(this.x);
  },
};

obj.f();
// OUTPUT: object
Arrow functions are a bit different because they inherit the this pointer of their creation context. So if we change our previous example to return an arrow function, then the this pointer at the time of creation will be globalThis.

globalThis.x = 'global';

const obj = {
  x: 'object',
  f: () => console.log(this.x),
};

obj.f();
// OUTPUT: global
However, if we make function in our object that returns an arrow function, then the this pointer will be the object's this pointer since that was the active context at the time the arrow function was created.

globalThis.x = 'global';

const obj = {
  x: 'object',
  make: function () {
    return () => console.log(this.x);
  },
};

const f = obj.make();
f();
// OUTPUT: object

### Modules javascript:
JavaScript modules allow for the partitioning and sharing of code. Initially JavaScript had no support for modules. Node.js, a server side JavaScript execution application, introduced the concept of modules in order to support the importing of packages of JavaScript from third party providers.

JavaScript got full module support with ES6, and they have become the standard module representation as browser support for ES modules is now almost universal.

In order to differentiate between the two implementations, Node.js modules are called CommonJS modules, and JavaScript modules are called ES modules. For this discussion, we will focus only on ES modules.

Because modules create a file-based scope for the code they represent, you must explicitly export the objects from one file and then import them into another file. For example, here is a simple module that exports a function that displays an alert.

alert.js

export function alertDisplay(msg) {
  alert(msg);
}
You can import the module's exported function into another module using the import keyword.

main.js

import { alertDisplay } from './alert.js';

alertDisplay('called from main.js');
ES Modules in the browser
When you use ES modules in the browser via HTML script references, things get a little complicated. The key thing to understand is that modules can only be called from other modules. You cannot access JavaScript contained in a module from the global scope that your non-module JavaScript is executing in.

From your HTML, you can specify that you are using an ES module by including a type attribute with the value of module in the script element. You can then import and use other modules. This is shown in the example below.

index.html

<script type="module">
  import { alertDisplay } from './alert.js';
  alertDisplay('module loaded');
</script>
If we want to use a module in the global scope that our HTML or other non-module JavaScript is executing in, then we must leak it into the global scope. We do this by either attaching an event handler or explicitly adding a function to the global window object. In the example below, we expose the alertDisplay imported module function by attaching it to the global JavaScript window object so that it can then be called from the button onclick handler. We also expose the module function by attaching a keypress event.

index.html

<html>
  <body>
    <script type="module">
      import { alertDisplay } from './alert.js';
      window.btnClick = alertDisplay;

      document.body.addEventListener('keypress', function (event) {
        alertDisplay('Key pressed');
      });
    </script>
    <button onclick="btnClick('button clicked')">Press me</button>
  </body>
</html>
Now, if the button is pushed or a key is pressed our ES module function will be called.

Modules with web frameworks
Fortunately, when you use a web framework bundler, discussed in later instruction, to generate your web application distribution code, you usually don't have to worry about differentiating between global scope and ES module scope. The bundler will inject all the necessary syntax to connect your HTML to your modules. Historically, this was done by removing the modules and placing all of the JavaScript in a namespaced global partition. Now that ES Modules are supported on most browsers, the bundler will expose the ES module directly.

Because of the complex history of modules they can be a confusing topic, but it is well worth the time to understand how they work as they are a core piece of a web programmer's toolkit.
