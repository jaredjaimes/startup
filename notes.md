## questions to ask the TA.
Can you demonstrate what it looks like to need to merge and then, how to do it exactly.

## Console:
- When ever you use the **"vi"** command in the console. There are certain command that you can type in for it to work the way you need it to. You can find all those commands here: [vim cheat sheet](https://vim.rtorr.com/)

## Https and Tls, and web certificates
- Https is the secure HTTP.
- If you want to create a secure (HTTPS) connection to your application, then it is not possible with just an IP address. Instead you want to use a domain name to represent your web application. That way you can make it easy to remember and secure. In order for you to do this you need to buy a domain name, and then create DNS records with a DNS (Domain Name System) server.
- **Route 53** is the AWS service that handles everything DNS-related. With Route 53 you can buy a domain name, host your domain on their DNS servers, and create DNS records.
- Having a HTTPS means that all data is encrypted using TLS protocol.
- You can see the negotiating secret of TLS by using the curl and -v. EX:
```
curl -v -s https://byu.edu > /dev/null
```
-**Web certificates** are generated by a trusted 3rd party using public/private key encryption. The certificate issuer is responsible for verifying that the certificate owner actually owns the domain name represented by the certificate
- Web certificates used to cost hundreds of a dollars a year, to renew and to get. 
- Until two brothers created a non-profit org called Let's Encrypt that created trusted web certificates. This broke the monopoly.
- Modern browsers now expect web servers to exclusively use HTTPS for all communication. In fact, the next version of HTTP (v3) only supports secure connections. For this reason, you should always support HTTPS for any web application that you build.
You can obtain, and renew, a web certificate by enabling the ACME protocol for your web server and communicating with Let's Encrypt to generate the needed certificates. This is not difficult to do, and many languages such as Rust, Node.js, or Go support this functionality by simply including an additional library.



## HTML/ Hypertext markup language
- Every element in html has a tag that represents the element.
- Every Html element also has attributes.
- **Attributes?** Describe the specific details of the element. Examples:
  - id : Which is an attribute that gives a unique id to the element to distinguish it from other elements.
  - class : this attribute classifies the element into a named group of elements.
- Attributes are written inside element tag with a name followed by an optional value. EX:
```
<p id="hello" class="greeting">Hello world</p>
```
- **Hyperlinks:** A hyperlink in html is represented by an anchor (a) element that has an attribute containing the address of the hyperlink reference (href). Example:
```
    -<a href="https://byu.edu">Go to the Y</a>
```
-**NOTE:** By default a web server will display the HTML file named **index.html**. So it is very common to name the main HTML file for your web application **index.html**.
-**Images:** When putting an image in html, you don't need and end </img>, you just need the attributes src= "URL" and alt = "name your image"
  - src - Specifies the path to the image
  - alt - Specifies an alternate text for the image (just so you know what the image is from code}
```
<img src="url" alt="alternatetext">
```
- But you can also use width and height attributes or just style attribute to edit it.
```
<img src="img_girl.jpg" alt="Girl in a jacket" width="500" height="600">
```
or
```
<img src="img_girl.jpg" alt="Girl in a jacket" style="width:500px;height:600px;">
```
-**TABLES:** This is how you do it:
```
<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Company</th>
    <th>Contact</th>
    <th>Country</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Alfreds Futterkiste</td>
    <td>Maria Anders</td>
    <td>Germany</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Centro comercial Moctezuma</td>
    <td>Francisco Chang</td>
    <td>Mexico</td>
  </tr>
</table>
```
