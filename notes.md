## questions to ask the TA.
Can you demonstrate what it looks like to need to merge and then, how to do it exactly.

## Console:
- When ever you use the **"vi"** command in the console. There are certain command that you can type in for it to work the way you need it to. You can find all those commands here: [vim cheat sheet](https://vim.rtorr.com/)

## Https and Tls, and web certificates
- Https is the secure HTTP.
- If you want to create a secure (HTTPS) connection to your application, then it is not possible with just an IP address. Instead you want to use a domain name to represent your web application. That way you can make it easy to remember and secure. In order for you to do this you need to buy a domain name, and then create DNS records with a DNS (Domain Name System) server.
- **Route 53** is the AWS service that handles everything DNS-related. With Route 53 you can buy a domain name, host your domain on their DNS servers, and create DNS records.
- Having a HTTPS means that all data is encrypted using TLS protocol.
- You can see the negotiating secret of TLS by using the curl and -v. EX:
```
curl -v -s https://byu.edu > /dev/null
```
-**Web certificates** are generated by a trusted 3rd party using public/private key encryption. The certificate issuer is responsible for verifying that the certificate owner actually owns the domain name represented by the certificate
- Web certificates used to cost hundreds of a dollars a year, to renew and to get. 
- Until two brothers created a non-profit org called Let's Encrypt that created trusted web certificates. This broke the monopoly.
- Modern browsers now expect web servers to exclusively use HTTPS for all communication. In fact, the next version of HTTP (v3) only supports secure connections. For this reason, you should always support HTTPS for any web application that you build.
You can obtain, and renew, a web certificate by enabling the ACME protocol for your web server and communicating with Let's Encrypt to generate the needed certificates. This is not difficult to do, and many languages such as Rust, Node.js, or Go support this functionality by simply including an additional library.



## HTML/ Hypertext markup language
- Every element in html has a tag that represents the element.
- Every Html element also has attributes.
- **Attributes?** Describe the specific details of the element. Examples:
  - id : Which is an attribute that gives a unique id to the element to distinguish it from other elements.
  - class : this attribute classifies the element into a named group of elements.
- Attributes are written inside element tag with a name followed by an optional value. EX:
```
<p id="hello" class="greeting">Hello world</p>
```
- **Hyperlinks:** A hyperlink in html is represented by an anchor (a) element that has an attribute containing the address of the hyperlink reference (href). Example:
```
    -<a href="https://byu.edu">Go to the Y</a>
```
-**NOTE:** By default a web server will display the HTML file named **index.html**. So it is very common to name the main HTML file for your web application **index.html**.

-**TABLES:** This is how you do it:
```
<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Company</th>
    <th>Contact</th>
    <th>Country</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Alfreds Futterkiste</td>
    <td>Maria Anders</td>
    <td>Germany</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Centro comercial Moctezuma</td>
    <td>Francisco Chang</td>
    <td>Mexico</td>
  </tr>
</table>
```
### External media:
- When ever using tags that reference external media you will always take a URL as an attribute with **src**.
  
-**Images:** When putting an image in html, you don't need and end </img>, you just need the attributes src= "URL" and alt = "name your image"
  - src - Specifies the path to the image
  - alt - Specifies an alternate text for the image (just so you know what the image is from code}
```
<img src="url" alt="alternatetext">
```
- But you can also use width and height attributes or just style attribute to edit it.
```
<img src="img_girl.jpg" alt="Girl in a jacket" width="500" height="600">
```
or
```
<img src="img_girl.jpg" alt="Girl in a jacket" style="width:500px;height:600px;">
```

-**Audio**:
  - When using the audio element specify url with src, then include controls attribute if you want user to control the audio playback. If you do not display the controls then there is no visual representation of the audio in the rendered page. The autoplay attribute starts the audio playing as soon as the audio file is loaded, and the loop attribute keeps it playing over and over.
```
<audio controls src="testAudio.mp3"></audio>
```

-**Video**: 
  - specify url with src.
  - like audio you can include the control, autoplay attributes.
  - *Note that you may need to include the crossorigin="anonymous" attribute if you are requesting files from a different domain than the one serving your content.*
```
<video controls width="300" crossorigin="anonymous">
  <source src="https://commondatastorage.googleapis.com/gtv-videos-bucket/sample/BigBuckBunny.mp4" />
</video>
```
Also: There is a github account with public videos to url from.

-**Internal Media**:
- The internal media elements svg and canvas allow you to actually create images directly within your HTML.
  - **SVG**: is an extremely powerful and widely supported way to render graphics inline in your HTML. An example SVG graphic that draws a black border and a red circle looks like this:
    ```
    <svg viewBox="0 0 300 200" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" stroke="red" fill="red" style="border: 1px solid #000000">
    <circle cx="150" cy="100" r="50" />
    </svg>
    ```
  - **Canvas**: element was introduced to HTML in order to facilitate 2D drawing and animation. The HTML for the canvas element is fairly simple, but actually drawing on the canvas requires JavaScript support. Here again, is our simple red dot example.
    ```
    <canvas id="canvasDemo" width="300" height="200" style="border: 1px solid #000000"></canvas>
    <script>
      const ctx = document.getElementById('canvasDemo').getContext('2d');
      ctx.beginPath();
      ctx.arc(150, 100, 50, 0, 2 * Math.PI);
      ctx.fillStyle = 'red';
      ctx.strokeStyle = 'red';
      ctx.fill();
      ctx.stroke();
    </script>
    ```


## HTML Glossary:
|Element | Meaning     |
|------|-------------|
|html| top-level page structure, or page container|
|head| contains the metadata about the page and page title, or header information|
|title| title of page (found in title bar)|
|body| define the main content structure of a web page, including text, images, links, and other HTML elements|
|main| specifies the main content of a document|
|h1 - h6| H1 tags are used to indicate the primary topic of your webpage to visitors and search engines. HTML heading tags, H1 to H6, are used to format the text on a page with H1 defining the most important and visually prominent heading on the page.|
|form|The <form> tag in HTML is used to create form for user input. There are many elements which are used within form tag. For example: <input>, <textarea>, <button>, <select>, <option>, <optgroup>, <fieldset>, <label>. ... input: It is used to specify the input field for user.|
|fieldset|The <fieldset> tag is used to group related elements in a form. The <fieldset> tag draws a box around the related elements.|
|!DOCTYPE html| All html documents must start with this|
|html lang="en"|This represent root of HTML document. The container for all html elements. Always include html lang attribute inside html taf to declare language of web page. To assit search engines.|
|Metadata| Metadata is not displayed. Defines the document title,character set, style, and other meta info|
|meta charset=" UTF-8" | makes it possible to use emojis and other characters that aren't in the traditional ASCII character set on your webpage. If you don't use the tag, then you will need to look up HTML entities to manually insert an emoji or other character.|
|meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" |sets the initial zoom level when the page is first loaded by the browser|
|nav| The <nav> element in HTML is used to represent a section of a page that contains navigation links. These links can be to other pages or to different parts of the same page |
|attribute= placeholder| 

## CSS:
- With CSS a web programmer can animate the page, deploy custom fonts, respond to user actions, and dynamically alter the entire layout of the page based on the size of a device and its orientation.
- CSS is primarily concerned with defining rulesets, or simply rules. A rule is comprised of a selector that selects the elements to apply the rule to, and one or more declarations that represent the property to style with the given property value.
Example:
```
p {
  font-family: sans-serif;
  font-size: 2em;
  color: navy;
  text-shadow: 3px 3px 1px #cccccc;
}
```
The selector p selects all paragraph elements in the HTML document. The four specified declarations then: 1) change the font to use a sans-serif font, 2) increase the font size to be twice as big as the default font, 3) change the text color to be navy, and 4) create a gray shadow for the text. The result looks like this.

### 3 ways to use CSS with HTML
The first way is to use the style attribute of an HTML element and explicitly assign one or more declarations.
```
<p style="color:green">CSS</p>
```
The next way to associate CSS is to use the HTML style element to define CSS rules within the HTML document. The style element should appear in the head element of the document so that the rules apply to all elements of the document.
```
<head>
  <style>
    p {
      color: green;
    }
  </style>
</head>
<body>
  <p>CSS</p>
</body>
```
The final way to associate CSS is to use the HTML link element to create a hyperlink reference to an external file containing CSS rules. The link element must appear in the head element of the document.
```
<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css" />
```
styles.css
```
p {
  color: green;
}
```
All of the above examples are equivalent, but using the link element usually is the preferred way to define CSS.

### The box model:
CSS defines everything as boxes. When you apply styles, you are applying them to a region of the display that is a rectangular box. Within an element's box there are several internal boxes. The innermost box holds the element's content. This is where things like the text or image of an element is displayed. Next comes the padding. The padding will inherit things like the background color. After padding is the border, which has properties like color, thickness and line style. The final box is the margin. The margin is considered external to the actual styling of the box and therefore only represents whitespace. It is important to understand each of these boxes so that you can achieve the desired visual result by applying the proper CSS declaration.


![cssBoxModel](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dec87aed-0604-4406-baa2-249ec9156705)


the width and height of an element is defined by the width and height of the content box.

### CSS Selectors:
An example of how to use HTML w/ css is can be found using this linnk:

### CSS Declerations:
This [Codepen](https://codepen.io/leesjensen/pen/rNKrgKQ) demonstrates the use of many of the above declarations. Take some time to experiment with it. Make sure you try modifying different selectors and declarations. Try different unit representations.

## CSS GLossary:
|Element | Meaning     |
|------|-------------|
|*| This selects all the HTML elements on the page.|
