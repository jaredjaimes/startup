## questions to ask the TA.
Can you demonstrate what it looks like to need to merge and then, how to do it exactly.

## Console:
- When ever you use the **"vi"** command in the console. There are certain command that you can type in for it to work the way you need it to. You can find all those commands here: [vim cheat sheet](https://vim.rtorr.com/)

## Https and Tls, and web certificates
- Https is the secure HTTP.
- If you want to create a secure (HTTPS) connection to your application, then it is not possible with just an IP address. Instead you want to use a domain name to represent your web application. That way you can make it easy to remember and secure. In order for you to do this you need to buy a domain name, and then create DNS records with a DNS (Domain Name System) server.
- **Route 53** is the AWS service that handles everything DNS-related. With Route 53 you can buy a domain name, host your domain on their DNS servers, and create DNS records.
- Having a HTTPS means that all data is encrypted using TLS protocol.
- You can see the negotiating secret of TLS by using the curl and -v. EX:
```
curl -v -s https://byu.edu > /dev/null
```
-**Web certificates** are generated by a trusted 3rd party using public/private key encryption. The certificate issuer is responsible for verifying that the certificate owner actually owns the domain name represented by the certificate
- Web certificates used to cost hundreds of a dollars a year, to renew and to get. 
- Until two brothers created a non-profit org called Let's Encrypt that created trusted web certificates. This broke the monopoly.
- Modern browsers now expect web servers to exclusively use HTTPS for all communication. In fact, the next version of HTTP (v3) only supports secure connections. For this reason, you should always support HTTPS for any web application that you build.
You can obtain, and renew, a web certificate by enabling the ACME protocol for your web server and communicating with Let's Encrypt to generate the needed certificates. This is not difficult to do, and many languages such as Rust, Node.js, or Go support this functionality by simply including an additional library.



## HTML/ Hypertext markup language
- Every element in html has a tag that represents the element.
- Every Html element also has attributes.
- **Attributes?** Describe the specific details of the element. Examples:
  - id : Which is an attribute that gives a unique id to the element to distinguish it from other elements.
  - class : this attribute classifies the element into a named group of elements.
- Attributes are written inside element tag with a name followed by an optional value. EX:
```
<p id="hello" class="greeting">Hello world</p>
```
- **Hyperlinks:** A hyperlink in html is represented by an anchor (a) element that has an attribute containing the address of the hyperlink reference (href). Example:
```
    -<a href="https://byu.edu">Go to the Y</a>
```
-**NOTE:** By default a web server will display the HTML file named **index.html**. So it is very common to name the main HTML file for your web application **index.html**.

-**TABLES:** This is how you do it:
```
<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Company</th>
    <th>Contact</th>
    <th>Country</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Alfreds Futterkiste</td>
    <td>Maria Anders</td>
    <td>Germany</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Centro comercial Moctezuma</td>
    <td>Francisco Chang</td>
    <td>Mexico</td>
  </tr>
</table>
```
### External media:
- When ever using tags that reference external media you will always take a URL as an attribute with **src**.
  
-**Images:** When putting an image in html, you don't need and end </img>, you just need the attributes src= "URL" and alt = "name your image"
  - src - Specifies the path to the image
  - alt - Specifies an alternate text for the image (just so you know what the image is from code}
```
<img src="url" alt="alternatetext">
```
- But you can also use width and height attributes or just style attribute to edit it.
```
<img src="img_girl.jpg" alt="Girl in a jacket" width="500" height="600">
```
or
```
<img src="img_girl.jpg" alt="Girl in a jacket" style="width:500px;height:600px;">
```

-**Audio**:
  - When using the audio element specify url with src, then include controls attribute if you want user to control the audio playback. If you do not display the controls then there is no visual representation of the audio in the rendered page. The autoplay attribute starts the audio playing as soon as the audio file is loaded, and the loop attribute keeps it playing over and over.
```
<audio controls src="testAudio.mp3"></audio>
```

-**Video**: 
  - specify url with src.
  - like audio you can include the control, autoplay attributes.
  - *Note that you may need to include the crossorigin="anonymous" attribute if you are requesting files from a different domain than the one serving your content.*
```
<video controls width="300" crossorigin="anonymous">
  <source src="https://commondatastorage.googleapis.com/gtv-videos-bucket/sample/BigBuckBunny.mp4" />
</video>
```
Also: There is a github account with public videos to url from.

-**Internal Media**:
- The internal media elements svg and canvas allow you to actually create images directly within your HTML.
  - **SVG**: is an extremely powerful and widely supported way to render graphics inline in your HTML. An example SVG graphic that draws a black border and a red circle looks like this:
    ```
    <svg viewBox="0 0 300 200" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" stroke="red" fill="red" style="border: 1px solid #000000">
    <circle cx="150" cy="100" r="50" />
    </svg>
    ```
  - **Canvas**: element was introduced to HTML in order to facilitate 2D drawing and animation. The HTML for the canvas element is fairly simple, but actually drawing on the canvas requires JavaScript support. Here again, is our simple red dot example.
    ```
    <canvas id="canvasDemo" width="300" height="200" style="border: 1px solid #000000"></canvas>
    <script>
      const ctx = document.getElementById('canvasDemo').getContext('2d');
      ctx.beginPath();
      ctx.arc(150, 100, 50, 0, 2 * Math.PI);
      ctx.fillStyle = 'red';
      ctx.strokeStyle = 'red';
      ctx.fill();
      ctx.stroke();
    </script>
    ```


## HTML Glossary:
|Element | Meaning     |
|------|-------------|
|html| top-level page structure, or page container|
|head| contains the metadata about the page and page title, or header information|
|title| title of page (found in title bar)|
|body| define the main content structure of a web page, including text, images, links, and other HTML elements|
|main| specifies the main content of a document|
|h1 - h6| H1 tags are used to indicate the primary topic of your webpage to visitors and search engines. HTML heading tags, H1 to H6, are used to format the text on a page with H1 defining the most important and visually prominent heading on the page.|
|form|The <form> tag in HTML is used to create form for user input. There are many elements which are used within form tag. For example: <input>, <textarea>, <button>, <select>, <option>, <optgroup>, <fieldset>, <label>. ... input: It is used to specify the input field for user.|
|fieldset|The <fieldset> tag is used to group related elements in a form. The <fieldset> tag draws a box around the related elements.|
|!DOCTYPE html| All html documents must start with this|
|html lang="en"|This represent root of HTML document. The container for all html elements. Always include html lang attribute inside html taf to declare language of web page. To assit search engines.|
|Metadata| Metadata is not displayed. Defines the document title,character set, style, and other meta info|
|meta charset=" UTF-8" | makes it possible to use emojis and other characters that aren't in the traditional ASCII character set on your webpage. If you don't use the tag, then you will need to look up HTML entities to manually insert an emoji or other character.|
|meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" |sets the initial zoom level when the page is first loaded by the browser|
|nav| The <nav> element in HTML is used to represent a section of a page that contains navigation links. These links can be to other pages or to different parts of the same page |
|attribute= placeholder| 

## CSS:
- With CSS a web programmer can animate the page, deploy custom fonts, respond to user actions, and dynamically alter the entire layout of the page based on the size of a device and its orientation.
- CSS is primarily concerned with defining rulesets, or simply rules. A rule is comprised of a selector that selects the elements to apply the rule to, and one or more declarations that represent the property to style with the given property value.
Example:
```
p {
  font-family: sans-serif;
  font-size: 2em;
  color: navy;
  text-shadow: 3px 3px 1px #cccccc;
}
```
The selector p selects all paragraph elements in the HTML document. The four specified declarations then: 1) change the font to use a sans-serif font, 2) increase the font size to be twice as big as the default font, 3) change the text color to be navy, and 4) create a gray shadow for the text. The result looks like this.


![cssSimpleRule](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/321557b9-fe82-4080-90ca-4ec67f1a4def)


### 3 ways to use CSS with HTML
The first way is to use the style attribute of an HTML element and explicitly assign one or more declarations.
```
<p style="color:green">CSS</p>
```
The next way to associate CSS is to use the HTML style element to define CSS rules within the HTML document. The style element should appear in the head element of the document so that the rules apply to all elements of the document.
```
<head>
  <style>
    p {
      color: green;
    }
  </style>
</head>
<body>
  <p>CSS</p>
</body>
```
The final way to associate CSS is to use the HTML link element to create a hyperlink reference to an external file containing CSS rules. The link element must appear in the head element of the document.
```
<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css" />
```
styles.css
```
p {
  color: green;
}
```
All of the above examples are equivalent, but using the link element usually is the preferred way to define CSS.

### The box model:
CSS defines everything as boxes. When you apply styles, you are applying them to a region of the display that is a rectangular box. Within an element's box there are several internal boxes. The innermost box holds the element's content. This is where things like the text or image of an element is displayed. Next comes the padding. The padding will inherit things like the background color. After padding is the border, which has properties like color, thickness and line style. The final box is the margin. The margin is considered external to the actual styling of the box and therefore only represents whitespace. It is important to understand each of these boxes so that you can achieve the desired visual result by applying the proper CSS declaration.


![cssBoxModel](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dec87aed-0604-4406-baa2-249ec9156705)


the width and height of an element is defined by the width and height of the content box.

### CSS Selectors:
Example: This is the html code: 
```
<body>
  <h1>Departments</h1>
  <p>welcome message</p>
  <section id="physics">
    <h2>Physics</h2>
    <p class="introduction">Introduction</p>
    <p>Text</p>
    <p class="summary">Summary</p>
  </section>
  <section id="chemistry">
    <h2>Chemistry</h2>
    <p class="introduction">Introduction</p>
    <p>Text</p>
    <p class="summary">Summary</p>
  </section>
</body>
```
- In the html code, you can give certain aspects of your code classes. Like introduction and summary.
- Then in CSS, you can specifically edit those classes by just calling them out using a period.
  ```
  .introduction {  }
  ```
- You can do the same to call specifc id's, using a hastag.
  ```
  #physics {  }
  ```
- You can do attributes.
- And you can do something called psuedo selector. Suppose we want our purple highlight bar to appear only when the mouse hovers over the text. To accomplish this we can change our ID selector to select whenever a section is hovered over.
  ```
  section:hover {  }
  ```
This is [CodePen](https://codepen.io/leesjensen/pen/NWzByav) to look into it more.

### CSS Declerations:
- Basically, the thingns you can say, units you can use, and ways to say color.
**List of declerations**
  Property	Value	Example	Discussion
background-color	color	red	Fill the background color
border	color width style	#fad solid medium	Sets the border using shorthand where any or all of the values may be provided
border-radius	unit	50%	The size of the border radius
box-shadow	x-offset y-offset blu-radius color	2px 2px 2px gray	Creates a shadow
columns	number	3	Number of textual columns
column-rule	color width style	solid thin black	Sets the border used between columns using border shorthand
color	color	rgb(128, 0, 0)	Sets the text color
cursor	type	grab	Sets the cursor to display when hovering over the element
display	type	none	Defines how to display the element and its children
filter	filter-function	grayscale(30%)	Applies a visual filter
float	direction	right	Places the element to the left or right in the flow
flex			Flex layout. Used for responsive design
font	family size style	Arial 1.2em bold	Defines the text font using shorthand
grid			Grid layout. Used for responsive design
height	unit	.25em	Sets the height of the box
margin	unit	5px 5px 0 0	Sets the margin spacing
max-[width/height]	unit	20%	Restricts the width or height to no more than the unit
min-[width/height]	unit	10vh	Restricts the width or height to no less than the unit
opacity	number	.9	Sets how opaque the element is
overflow	[visible/hidden/scroll/auto]	scroll	Defines what happens when the content does not fix in its box
position	[static/relative/absolute/sticky]	absolute	Defines how the element is positioned in the document
padding	unit	1em 2em	Sets the padding spacing
left	unit	10rem	The horizontal value of a positioned element
text-align	[start/end/center/justify]	end	Defines how the text is aligned in the element
top	unit	50px	The vertical value of a positioned element
transform	transform-function	rotate(0.5turn)	Applies a transformation to the element
width	unit	25vmin	Sets the width of the box
z-index	number	100	Controls the positioning of the element on the z axis

This [Codepen](https://codepen.io/leesjensen/pen/rNKrgKQ) demonstrates the use of many of the above declarations. Take some time to experiment with it. Make sure you try modifying different selectors and declarations. Try different unit representations.

### CSS Fonts:
- There are four major families of fonts: Serif, sans-serif, fixed, and symbol.
- However, you can import fonts using the @font-face rule and by providing the font name and source location.
  ```
  @font-face {
  font-family: 'Quicksand';
  src: url('https://cs260.click/fonts/quicksand.ttf');
  }

  p {
    font-family: Quicksand;
  }
  ```
- If you don't want to do that you can get it from provider like google who have a large selection of open source fonts that you can use without paying any royalties. The easiest way to use Google fonts is to use a CSS import statement to reference the Google Font Service. This will automatically generate the CSS for importing the font.
  ```
  @import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Rubik Microbe&display=swap');

  p {
    font-family: 'Rubik Microbe';
  }
  ```

[CodePen](https://codepen.io/leesjensen/pen/zYaLgVW)

### CSS Animations:
-  You create CSS animations using the animation properties and defining keyframes for what the element should look like at different times in the animation.
Ex:
- We have a paragraph of centered text and we want it to zoom in until its size is 20% of the view height.
  ```
  p {
    text-align: center;
    font-size: 20vh;
  }
  ```
- Then we select the elements by adding the animation-name property with a value of demo. This name refers to the name of the keyframes that we will specify in a minute. The keyframes tell what CSS properites should be applied at different key points in the animation sequence.
-  We also add an animation-duration property in order to specify that the animation should last for three seconds.
  ```
  p {
    text-align: center;
    font-size: 20vh;
  
    animation-name: demo;
    animation-duration: 3s;
  }
  ```
- Now we are ready to create the keyframes. We need define the key points, and CSS will generate a smooth transition to move from one keyframe to another.
- So if we want to start with text that is invisible and have it zoom into the full final size. We can do this with two frames that are designated with the keywords from and to.
  ```
  @keyframes demo {
    from {
      font-size: 0vh;
    }
  
    to {
      font-size: 20vh;
    }
  }
  ```
- It would look better if towards the end, the paragraph bounced out a little bigger than its final size. We can accommodate that by adding another key frame that happens 95 percent through the animation.
  ```
  @keyframes demo {
    from {
      font-size: 0vh;
    }
  
    95% {
      font-size: 21vh;
    }
  
    to {
      font-size: 20vh;
    }
  }
  ```

### Responsive Design:
-  This ability to reconfigure the interface so the application accommodates and takes advantage of the screen's size and orientation is called responsive design

|Value|	Meaning|
|-----|--------|
|none|	Don't display this element. The element still exists, but the browser will not render it.|
|block|	Display this element with a width that fills its parent element. A p or div element has block display by default.|
|inline|	Display this element with a width that is only as big as its content. A b or span element has inline display by default.|
|flex	|Display this element's children in a flexible orientation.|
|grid	|Display this element's children in a grid orientation.|

- include a meta tag in the head element of all your HTML pages. This tells the browser to not scale the page.
  ```
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width,initial-scale=1" />
  ```
  
- The float css property moves an element to the left or right of its container element and allows inline elements to wrap around it. For example, if we had an aside element followed by a large paragraph of text, we could create the following CSS rule in order to cause the text to wrap around the aside.
  ```
  aside {
    float: right;
    padding: 3em;
    margin: 0.5em;
    border: black solid thin;
  }
  ```
![cssFloat](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f75302ca-3e05-4d51-a604-f1945d7a46fa)

- When the browser resizes, the text will flow around the floating element. You can use this CodePen to experiment with float. Try changing the descriptor value to none or left and see what happens.


- One of the main CSS features for creating responsive applications is the @media selector. This selector dynamically detects the size and orientation of the device and applies CSS rules to represent the structure of the HTML in a way that accommodates the change.
- We can use the @media selector to tell us which side of the screen (technically the viewport) is the longest. A media query takes one or more predicates separated by boolean operators. In our case we simply want to know if the screen is oriented in portrait mode (short side on top) or not. If it is then we transform all of our div elements by rotating them 270 degrees.
  ```
  @media (orientation: portrait) {
    div {
      transform: rotate(270deg);
    }
  }
  ```
- You can also use media queries to make entire pieces of your application disappear, or move to a different location. For example, if we had an aside that was helpful when the screen is wide, but took up too much room when the screen got narrow, we could use the following media query to make it disappear.
  ```
  @media (orientation: portrait) {
    aside {
      display: none;
    }
  }
  ```
### Grid:
- The grid display layout is useful when you want to display a group of child elements in a responsive grid. We start with a container element that has a bunch of child elements.
  ```
  <div class="container">
    <div class="card"></div>
    <div class="card"></div>
    <div class="card"></div>
    <div class="card"></div>
    <div class="card"></div>
    <div class="card"></div>
    <div class="card"></div>
    <div class="card"></div>
    <div class="card"></div>
  </div>
  ```
We turn this into a responsive grid by including a CSS display property with the value of grid on the container element. This tells the browser that all of the children of this element are to be displayed in a grid flow. The grid-template-columns property specifies the layout of the grid columns. We set this to repeatedly define each column to auto-fill the parent element's width with children that are resized to a minimum of 300 pixels and a maximum of one equal fractional unit (1fr) of the parents total width. A fractional unit is dynamically computed by splitting up the parent element's width into equal parts. Next, we fix the height of the rows to be exactly 300 pixels by specifying the grid-auto-rows property. Finally, we finish off the grid configuration by setting the grid-gap property to have a gap of at least 1 em between each grid item.
  ```
  .container {
    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fill, minmax(300px, 1fr));
    grid-auto-rows: 300px;
    grid-gap: 1em;
  }
  ```
![cssGrid](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/23176d90-03f2-4a32-9bce-d237fa6ba003)

### Flex:
- The flex display layout is useful when you want to partition your application into areas that responsively move around as the window resizes or the orientation changes.

justify-content: center; this centers content in relation to what is the box it is in. SO its not just centerd at the top of the box but in the middle of the entire box it is in.
flex: 1; this makes sure the page can expand or grow. If you don't have your main part of your page set to that then it will always stay small.
Also, need to have the html set to 100% so it can grow that length.

### Bootstrap:



## CSS GLossary:
|Element | Meaning     |
|------|-------------|
|*| This selects all the HTML elements on the page.|
|body| elements surrounds all of a page's content that will actually be rendereed on the web page|
|padding| used to create space around an element's content, inside of any defined borders.|
|padding: lem| This applies to all 4 sides.|
|font-weight| changes how bulky the font looks, how bold it is in a way.|
|td|used for table data cells|
|th|used for table header cells|


## JavaScript:

To output: 
```
console.log('Hello' + ' ' + 'world');
// OUTPUT: Hello world
```
To create a function:
```
function join(a, b) {
  return a + ' ' + b;
}
```
NOTE: Use your browser's debugger. For example, if you open Chrome and press F12 the debugger will display. Select the Console menu option. This will display a JavaScript interpreter where you can write and execute your code.

The basic usage of the console object is to output a log message.
```
console.log('hello');
// OUTPUT: hello
```
You can create formatted messages in the log parameter.
```
console.log('hello %s', 'world');
// OUTPUT: hello world
```
You can even specify CSS declarations in order to style the log output.
```
console.log('%c JavaScript Demo', 'font-size:1.5em; color:green;');
// OUTPUT: JavaScript Demo //in large green text
```
- Timers
If you are trying to see how long a piece of code is running you can wrap it with time and timeEnd calls and it will output the duration between the time and timeEnd calls.
```
console.time('demo time');
// ... some code that takes a long time.
console.timeEnd('demo time');
// OUTPUT: demo time: 9762.74 ms
```
- Count
To see how many times a block of code is called you can use the count function.
```
console.count('a');
// OUTPUT: a: 1
console.count('a');
// OUTPUT: a: 2
console.count('b');
// OUTPUT: b: 1
```
#### Adding JavaScript to HTML:
- You can insert JavaScript into HTML either by directly including it in the HTML within the content of a <script> element, or by using the src attribute of the script element to reference an external JavaScript file.
  
index.js
```
function sayHello() {
  console.log('hello');
}
```
index.html
```
<head>
  <script src="javascript.js"></script>
</head>
<body>
  <button onclick="sayHello()">Say Hello</button>
  <button onclick="sayGoodbye()">Say Goodbye</button>
  <script>
    function sayGoodbye() {
      alert('Goodbye');
    }
  </script>
</body>
```
Notice that we call the sayHello and sayGoodbye JavaScript functions from the HTML in the onclick attribute of the button element. Special attributes like onclick automatically create event listeners for different DOM events that call the code contained in the attribute's value. The code specified by the attribute value can be a simple call to a function or any JavaScript code.
```
<button onclick="let i=1;i++;console.log(i)">press me</button>
<!-- OUTPUT: 2 -->
```

#### JavaScript type and construct:

- Variables are declared using either the let or const keyword. let allows you to change the value of the variable while const will cause an error if you attempt to change it.
```
let x = 1;

const y = 2;
```
Type:

|Type|	Meaning|
|----|---------|
|Null|	The type of a variable that has not been assigned a value.|
|Undefined|	The type of a variable that has not been defined.|
|Boolean|	true or false.|
|Number|	A 64-bit signed number.|
|BigInt|	A number of arbitrary magnitude.|
|String|	A textual sequence of characters.|
|Symbol|	A unique value.|

Type	Use	Example
Object	A collection of properties represented by name-value pairs. Values can be of any type.	{a:3, b:'fish'}
Function	An object that has the ability to be called.	function a() {}
Date	Calendar dates and times.	new Date('1995-12-17')
Array	An ordered sequence of any type.	[3, 'fish']
Map	A collection of key-value pairs that support efficient lookups.	new Map()
JSON	A lightweight data-interchange format used to share information across programs.	{"a":3, "b":"fish"}

Common Operations:
When dealing with a number variable, JavaScript supports standard mathematical operators like + (add), - (subtract), * (multiply), / (divide), and === (equality). For string variables, JavaScript supports + (concatenation) and === (equality).

Type conversions
JavaScript is a weakly typed language. That means that a variable always has a type, but the variable can change type when it is assigned a new value, or that types can be automatically converted based upon the context that they are used in. Sometimes the results of automatic conversions can be unexpected from programmers who are used to strongly typed languages. Consider the following examples.
```
2 + '3';
// OUTPUT: '23'
2 * '3';
// OUTPUT: 6
[2] + [3];
// OUTPUT: '23'
true + null;
// OUTPUT: 1
true + undefined;
// OUTPUT: NaN
```
Getting unexpected results is especially common when dealing with the equality operator.
```
1 == '1';
// OUTPUT: true
null == undefined;
// OUTPUT: true
'' == false;
// OUTPUT: true
```
⚠ The unexpected results happen in JavaScript because it uses complex rules for defining equality that depend upon the conversion of a type to a boolean value. You will sometimes hear this referred to as falsy and truthy evaluations. To remove this confusion, JavaScript introduced the strict equality (===) and inequality (!==) operators. The strict operators skip the type conversion when computing equality. This results in the following.
```
1 === '1';
// OUTPUT: false
null === undefined;
// OUTPUT: false
'' === false;
// OUTPUT: false
```
Because strict equality is considered more intuitive, it is almost always preferred and should be used in your code.

Here is a fun example of JavaScript's type conversion. Execute the following in the browser's debugger console.
```
('b' + 'a' + +'a' + 'a').toLowerCase();
```
Conditionals
JavaScript supports many common programming language conditional constructs. This includes if, else, and if else. Here are some examples.
```
if (a === 1) {
  //...
} else if (b === 2) {
  //...
} else {
  //...
}
```
You can also use the ternary operator. This provides a compact if else representation.
```
a === 1 ? console.log(1) : console.log('not 1');
```
You can use boolean operations in the expression to create complex predicates. Common boolean operators include && (and), || (or), and ! (not).
```
if (true && (!false || true)) {
  //...
}
```
Loops
JavaScript supports many common programming language looping constructs. This includes for, for in, for of, while, do while, and switch. Here are some examples.

for
Note the introduction of the common post increment operation (i++) for adding one to a number.
```
for (let i = 0; i < 2; i++) {
  console.log(i);
}
// OUTPUT: 0 1
```
do while
```
let i = 0;
do {
  console.log(i);
  i++;
} while (i < 2);
// OUTPUT: 0 1
```
while
```
let i = 0;
while (i < 2) {
  console.log(i);
  i++;
}
// OUTPUT: 0 1
```
for in
The for in statement iterates over an object's property names.
```
const obj = { a: 1, b: 'fish' };
for (const name in obj) {
  console.log(name);
}
// OUTPUT: a
// OUTPUT: b
```
For arrays the object's name is the array index.
```
const arr = ['a', 'b'];
for (const name in arr) {
  console.log(name);
}
// OUTPUT: 0
// OUTPUT: 1
```
for of
The for of statement iterates over an iterable's (Array, Map, Set, ...) property values.
```
const arr = ['a', 'b'];
for (const val of arr) {
  console.log(val);
}
// OUTPUT: 'a'
// OUTPUT: 'b'
```
Break and continue
All of the looping constructs demonstrated above allow for either a break or continue statement to abort or advance the loop.
```
let i = 0;
while (true) {
  console.log(i);
  if (i === 0) {
    i++;
    continue;
  } else {
    break;
  }
}
// OUTPUT: 0 1
```

#### JavaScript String:

Strings are a primitive type in JavaScript. A string variable is specified by surrounding a sequence of characters with single quotes ('), double quotes ("), or backticks (`). The meaning of single or double quotes are equivalent, but the backtick defines a string literal that may contain JavaScript that is evaluated in place and concatenated into the string. A string literal replacement specifier is declared with a dollar sign followed by a curly brace pair. Anything inside the curly braces is evaluated as JavaScript. You can also use backticks to create multiline strings without having to explicitly escape the newline characters using \n.
```
'quoted text'; // " also works

const l = 'literal';
console.log(`string ${l + (1 + 1)} text`);
// OUTPUT: string literal2 text
```
Unicode support
JavaScript supports Unicode by defining a string as a sequence of 16-bit unsigned integers that represent UTF-16-encoded characters. Unicode support allows JavaScript to represent most languages spoken on the planet. This includes those that are read from right to left.
```

However, there are several important steps you must take in order to make your web application fully internationalized. This includes handling of currency, time, dates, iconography, units of measure, keyboard layouts, and respecting local customs. Read this article on the W3C website to learn more about internationalization.

String functions
The string object has several interesting functions associated with it. Here are some of the commonly used ones.

|Function	|Meaning|
|---------|-------|
|length	|The number of characters in the string|
|indexOf()	|The starting index of a given substring|
|split()	|Split the string into an array on the given delimiter string|
|startsWith()	|True if the string has a given prefix|
|endsWith()	|True if the string has a given suffix|
|toLowerCase()	|Converts all characters to lowercase|

```
const s = 'Example:조선글';

console.log(s.length);
// OUTPUT: 11
console.log(s.indexOf('조선글'));
// OUTPUT: 8
console.log(s.split(':'));
// OUTPUT: ['Example', '조선글']
console.log(s.startsWith('Ex'));
// OUTPUT: true
console.log(s.endsWith('조선글'));
// OUTPUT: true
console.log(s.toLowerCase());
// OUTPUT: example:조선글
```
#### Functions:
In JavaScript functions are first class objects. That means that they can be assigned a name, passed as a parameter, returned as a result, and referenced from an object or array just like any other variable.

The basic syntax of a function begins with the function keyword followed by zero or more parameters and a body that may contain zero or more return statements. The return statement may return a single value. Note that there are no type declarations, as the type is always inferred by the assignment of the value to the parameter.

function hello(who) {
  return 'hello ' + who;
}

console.log(hello('world'));
// OUTPUT: hello world
A function without a return value usually exists to produce some side effect like modifying a parameter or interacting with an external program. In the following example the side effect of the function is to output text to the debugger console.

function hello(who) {
  who.count++;
  console.log('hello ' + who.name);
}

hello({ name: 'world', count: 0 });
// OUTPUT: hello world
Function parameters
When a function is called, the caller may choose what parameters to provide. If a parameter is not provided then the value of the parameter is undefined when the function executes.

In addition to explicitly passing the value of a parameter to a function, the function can define a default value. This is done by assigning a value to the parameter in the function declaration.

function labeler(value, title = 'title') {
  console.log(`${title}=${value}`);
}

labeler();
// OUTPUT: title=undefined

labeler('fish');
// OUTPUT: title=fish

labeler('fish', 'animal');
// OUTPUT: animal=fish
Anonymous functions
Functions in JavaScript are commonly assigned to a variable so that they can be passed as a parameter to some other function or stored as an object property. To easily support this common use you can define a function anonymously and assign it to a variable.

// Function that takes a function as a parameter
function doMath(operation, a, b) {
  return operation(a, b);
}

// Anonymous function assigned to a variable
const add = function (a, b) {
  return a + b;
};

console.log(doMath(add, 5, 3));
// OUTPUT: 8

// Anonymous function assigned to a parameter
console.log(
  doMath(
    function (a, b) {
      return a - b;
    },
    5,
    3
  )
);
// OUTPUT: 2
Creating, passing, and returning functions
Here are examples of assigning functions to variables, as well as using functions as parameters and return values.

// Anonymous declaration of the function that is later assigned to a variable
const add = function (a, b) {
  return a + b;
};

// Function that logs as a side effect of its execution
function labeler(label, value) {
  console.log(label + '=' + value);
}

// Function that takes a function as a parameter and then executes the function as a side effect
function addAndLabel(labeler, label, adder, a, b) {
  labeler(label, adder(a, b));
}

// Passing a function to a function
addAndLabel(labeler, 'a+b', add, 1, 3);
// OUTPUT: a+b=4

// Function that returns a function
function labelMaker(label) {
  return function (value) {
    console.log(label + '=' + value);
  };
}

// Assign a function from the return value of the function
const nameLabeler = labelMaker('name');

// Calling the returned function
nameLabeler('value');
// OUTPUT: name=value
Inner functions
Functions can also be declared inside other functions. This allows you to modularize your code without always exposing private details.

function labeler(value) {
  function stringLabeler(value) {
    console.log('string=' + value);
  }
  function numberLabeler(value) {
    console.log('number=' + value);
  }

  if (typeof value == 'string') {
    stringLabeler(value);
  } else if (typeof value == 'number') {
    numberLabeler(value);
  }
}

labeler(5);
// OUTPUT: number=5

labeler('fish');
// OUTPUT: string=fish

#### JavaScript arrow function:
Because functions are first order objects in JavaScript they can be declared anywhere and passed as parameters. This results in code with lots of anonymous functions cluttering things up. To make the code more compact the arrow syntax was created. This syntax replaces the need for the function keyword with the symbols => placed after the parameter declaration. The enclosing curly braces are also optional.

This is a function in arrow syntax that takes no parameters and always returns 3.

() => 3;
The following two invocations of sort are equivalent.

const a = [1, 2, 3, 4];

// standard function syntax
a.sort(function (v1, v2) {
  return v1 - v2;
});

// arrow function syntax
a.sort((v1, v2) => v1 - v2);
Besides being compact, the arrow function syntax has some important semantic differences from the standard function syntax. This includes restrictions that arrow functions cannot be used for constructors or iterator generators.

Return values
Arrow functions also have special rules for the return keyword. The return keyword is optional if no curly braces are provided for the function and it contains a single expression. In that case the result of the expression is automatically returned. If curly braces are provided then the arrow function behaves just like a standard function.

() => 3;
// RETURNS: 3

() => {
  3;
};
// RETURNS: undefined

() => {
  return 3;
};
// RETURNS: 3
This pointer
Next, arrow functions inherit the this pointer from the scope in which they are created. This makes what is known as a closure. A closure allows a function to continue referencing its creation scope, even after it has passed out of that scope. This can be tricky to wrap your head around, and we discuss it in detail when we later talk about JavaScript scope. For now consider the following example.

The function makeClosure returns an anonymous function using the arrow syntax. Notice that the a parameter is overridden, a new b variable is created, and both a and b are referenced in the arrow function. Because of that reference, they are both part of the closure for the returned function.

function makeClosure(a) {
  a = 'a2';
  const b = 'b2';
  return () => [a, b];
}
Next, we declare the variables a and b at the top level scope, and call makeClosure with a.

const a = 'a';
const b = 'b';

const closure = makeClosure(a);
Now, when we call the closure function, it will output the values contained in the scope in which it was created, instead of the current values of the variables.

console.log(closure());
// OUTPUT: ['a2', 'b2']

console.log(a, b);
// OUTPUT: 'a' 'b'
Closures provide a valuable property when we do things like execute JavaScript within the scope of an HTML page, because it can remember the values of variables when the function was created instead of what they are when they are executed.

Putting it all together
Now that you know how functions work in JavaScript, let's look at an example that demonstrates the use of functions, arrow functions, parameters, a function as a parameter (callback), closures, and browser event listeners. This is done by implementing a debounce function.

The point of a debounce function is to only execute a specified function once within a given time window. Any requests to execute the debounce function more frequently than this will case the time window to reset. This is important in cases where a user can trigger expensive events thousands of times per second. Without a debounce the performance of your application can greatly suffer.

The following code calls the browser's window.addEventListener function to add a callback function that is invoked whenever the user scrolls the browser's web page. The first parameter to addEventListener specifies that it wants to listen for scroll events. The second parameter provides the function to call when a scroll event happens. In this case we call a function named debounce.

The debounce function takes two parameters, the time window for executing the window function, and the window function to call within that limit. In this case we will execute the arrow function at most every 500 milliseconds.

window.addEventListener(
  'scroll',
  debounce(500, () => {
    console.log('Executed an expensive calculation');
  })
);
The debounce function implements the execution of windowFunc within the restricted time window by creating a closure that contains the current timeout and returning a function that will reset the timeout every time it is called. The returned function is what the scroll event will actually call when the user scrolls the page. However, instead of directly executing the windowFunc it sets a timer based on the value of windowMs. If the debounce function is called again before the window times out then it resets the timeout.

function debounce(windowMs, windowFunc) {
  let timeout;
  return function () {
    console.log('scroll event');
    clearTimeout(timeout);
    timeout = setTimeout(() => windowFunc(), windowMs);
  };
}
You can experiment with this in CodePen. In this example, the background color will change as long as the user is scrolling. When they stop the background reverts back to white.
