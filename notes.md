## questions to ask the TA.
Can you demonstrate what it looks like to need to merge and then, how to do it exactly.

## Console:
- When ever you use the **"vi"** command in the console. There are certain command that you can type in for it to work the way you need it to. You can find all those commands here: [vim cheat sheet](https://vim.rtorr.com/)

## Https and Tls, and web certificates
- Https is the secure HTTP.
- If you want to create a secure (HTTPS) connection to your application, then it is not possible with just an IP address. Instead you want to use a domain name to represent your web application. That way you can make it easy to remember and secure. In order for you to do this you need to buy a domain name, and then create DNS records with a DNS (Domain Name System) server.
- **Route 53** is the AWS service that handles everything DNS-related. With Route 53 you can buy a domain name, host your domain on their DNS servers, and create DNS records.
- Having a HTTPS means that all data is encrypted using TLS protocol.
- You can see the negotiating secret of TLS by using the curl and -v. EX:
```
curl -v -s https://byu.edu > /dev/null
```
-**Web certificates** are generated by a trusted 3rd party using public/private key encryption. The certificate issuer is responsible for verifying that the certificate owner actually owns the domain name represented by the certificate
- Web certificates used to cost hundreds of a dollars a year, to renew and to get. 
- Until two brothers created a non-profit org called Let's Encrypt that created trusted web certificates. This broke the monopoly.
- Modern browsers now expect web servers to exclusively use HTTPS for all communication. In fact, the next version of HTTP (v3) only supports secure connections. For this reason, you should always support HTTPS for any web application that you build.
You can obtain, and renew, a web certificate by enabling the ACME protocol for your web server and communicating with Let's Encrypt to generate the needed certificates. This is not difficult to do, and many languages such as Rust, Node.js, or Go support this functionality by simply including an additional library.



## HTML/ Hypertext markup language
- Every element in html has a tag that represents the element.
- Every Html element also has attributes.
- **Attributes?** Describe the specific details of the element. Examples:
  - id : Which is an attribute that gives a unique id to the element to distinguish it from other elements.
  - class : this attribute classifies the element into a named group of elements.
- Attributes are written inside element tag with a name followed by an optional value. EX:
```
<p id="hello" class="greeting">Hello world</p>
```
- **Hyperlinks:** A hyperlink in html is represented by an anchor (a) element that has an attribute containing the address of the hyperlink reference (href). Example:
```
    -<a href="https://byu.edu">Go to the Y</a>
```
-**NOTE:** By default a web server will display the HTML file named **index.html**. So it is very common to name the main HTML file for your web application **index.html**.

-**TABLES:** This is how you do it:
```
<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Company</th>
    <th>Contact</th>
    <th>Country</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Alfreds Futterkiste</td>
    <td>Maria Anders</td>
    <td>Germany</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Centro comercial Moctezuma</td>
    <td>Francisco Chang</td>
    <td>Mexico</td>
  </tr>
</table>
```
### External media:
- When ever using tags that reference external media you will always take a URL as an attribute with **src**.
  
-**Images:** When putting an image in html, you don't need and end </img>, you just need the attributes src= "URL" and alt = "name your image"
  - src - Specifies the path to the image
  - alt - Specifies an alternate text for the image (just so you know what the image is from code}
```
<img src="url" alt="alternatetext">
```
- But you can also use width and height attributes or just style attribute to edit it.
```
<img src="img_girl.jpg" alt="Girl in a jacket" width="500" height="600">
```
or
```
<img src="img_girl.jpg" alt="Girl in a jacket" style="width:500px;height:600px;">
```

-**Audio**:
  - When using the audio element specify url with src, then include controls attribute if you want user to control the audio playback. If you do not display the controls then there is no visual representation of the audio in the rendered page. The autoplay attribute starts the audio playing as soon as the audio file is loaded, and the loop attribute keeps it playing over and over.
```
<audio controls src="testAudio.mp3"></audio>
```

-**Video**: 
  - specify url with src.
  - like audio you can include the control, autoplay attributes.
  - *Note that you may need to include the crossorigin="anonymous" attribute if you are requesting files from a different domain than the one serving your content.*
```
<video controls width="300" crossorigin="anonymous">
  <source src="https://commondatastorage.googleapis.com/gtv-videos-bucket/sample/BigBuckBunny.mp4" />
</video>
```
Also: There is a github account with public videos to url from.

-**Internal Media**:
- The internal media elements svg and canvas allow you to actually create images directly within your HTML.
  - **SVG**: is an extremely powerful and widely supported way to render graphics inline in your HTML. An example SVG graphic that draws a black border and a red circle looks like this:
    ```
    <svg viewBox="0 0 300 200" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" stroke="red" fill="red" style="border: 1px solid #000000">
    <circle cx="150" cy="100" r="50" />
    </svg>
    ```
  - **Canvas**: element was introduced to HTML in order to facilitate 2D drawing and animation. The HTML for the canvas element is fairly simple, but actually drawing on the canvas requires JavaScript support. Here again, is our simple red dot example.
    ```
    <canvas id="canvasDemo" width="300" height="200" style="border: 1px solid #000000"></canvas>
    <script>
      const ctx = document.getElementById('canvasDemo').getContext('2d');
      ctx.beginPath();
      ctx.arc(150, 100, 50, 0, 2 * Math.PI);
      ctx.fillStyle = 'red';
      ctx.strokeStyle = 'red';
      ctx.fill();
      ctx.stroke();
    </script>
    ```


## HTML Glossary:
|Element | Meaning     |
|------|-------------|
|html| top-level page structure, or page container|
|head| contains the metadata about the page and page title, or header information|
|title| title of page (found in title bar)|
|body| define the main content structure of a web page, including text, images, links, and other HTML elements|
|main| specifies the main content of a document|
|h1 - h6| H1 tags are used to indicate the primary topic of your webpage to visitors and search engines. HTML heading tags, H1 to H6, are used to format the text on a page with H1 defining the most important and visually prominent heading on the page.|
|form|The <form> tag in HTML is used to create form for user input. There are many elements which are used within form tag. For example: <input>, <textarea>, <button>, <select>, <option>, <optgroup>, <fieldset>, <label>. ... input: It is used to specify the input field for user.|
|fieldset|The <fieldset> tag is used to group related elements in a form. The <fieldset> tag draws a box around the related elements.|
|!DOCTYPE html| All html documents must start with this|
|html lang="en"|This represent root of HTML document. The container for all html elements. Always include html lang attribute inside html taf to declare language of web page. To assit search engines.|
|Metadata| Metadata is not displayed. Defines the document title,character set, style, and other meta info|
|meta charset=" UTF-8" | makes it possible to use emojis and other characters that aren't in the traditional ASCII character set on your webpage. If you don't use the tag, then you will need to look up HTML entities to manually insert an emoji or other character.|
|meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" |sets the initial zoom level when the page is first loaded by the browser|
|nav| The <nav> element in HTML is used to represent a section of a page that contains navigation links. These links can be to other pages or to different parts of the same page |
|attribute= placeholder| 

## CSS:
- With CSS a web programmer can animate the page, deploy custom fonts, respond to user actions, and dynamically alter the entire layout of the page based on the size of a device and its orientation.
- CSS is primarily concerned with defining rulesets, or simply rules. A rule is comprised of a selector that selects the elements to apply the rule to, and one or more declarations that represent the property to style with the given property value.
Example:
```
p {
  font-family: sans-serif;
  font-size: 2em;
  color: navy;
  text-shadow: 3px 3px 1px #cccccc;
}
```
The selector p selects all paragraph elements in the HTML document. The four specified declarations then: 1) change the font to use a sans-serif font, 2) increase the font size to be twice as big as the default font, 3) change the text color to be navy, and 4) create a gray shadow for the text. The result looks like this.

### 3 ways to use CSS with HTML
The first way is to use the style attribute of an HTML element and explicitly assign one or more declarations.
```
<p style="color:green">CSS</p>
```
The next way to associate CSS is to use the HTML style element to define CSS rules within the HTML document. The style element should appear in the head element of the document so that the rules apply to all elements of the document.
```
<head>
  <style>
    p {
      color: green;
    }
  </style>
</head>
<body>
  <p>CSS</p>
</body>
```
The final way to associate CSS is to use the HTML link element to create a hyperlink reference to an external file containing CSS rules. The link element must appear in the head element of the document.
```
<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css" />
```
styles.css
```
p {
  color: green;
}
```
All of the above examples are equivalent, but using the link element usually is the preferred way to define CSS.

### The box model:
CSS defines everything as boxes. When you apply styles, you are applying them to a region of the display that is a rectangular box. Within an element's box there are several internal boxes. The innermost box holds the element's content. This is where things like the text or image of an element is displayed. Next comes the padding. The padding will inherit things like the background color. After padding is the border, which has properties like color, thickness and line style. The final box is the margin. The margin is considered external to the actual styling of the box and therefore only represents whitespace. It is important to understand each of these boxes so that you can achieve the desired visual result by applying the proper CSS declaration.


![cssBoxModel](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dec87aed-0604-4406-baa2-249ec9156705)


the width and height of an element is defined by the width and height of the content box.

### CSS Selectors:
Example: This is the html code: 
```
<body>
  <h1>Departments</h1>
  <p>welcome message</p>
  <section id="physics">
    <h2>Physics</h2>
    <p class="introduction">Introduction</p>
    <p>Text</p>
    <p class="summary">Summary</p>
  </section>
  <section id="chemistry">
    <h2>Chemistry</h2>
    <p class="introduction">Introduction</p>
    <p>Text</p>
    <p class="summary">Summary</p>
  </section>
</body>
```
- In the html code, you can give certain aspects of your code classes. Like introduction and summary.
- Then in CSS, you can specifically edit those classes by just calling them out using a period.
  ```
  .introduction {  }
  ```
- You can do the same to call specifc id's, using a hastag.
  ```
  #physics {  }
  ```
- You can do attributes.
- And you can do something called psuedo selector. Suppose we want our purple highlight bar to appear only when the mouse hovers over the text. To accomplish this we can change our ID selector to select whenever a section is hovered over.
  ```
  section:hover {  }
  ```
This is [CodePen](https://codepen.io/leesjensen/pen/NWzByav) to look into it more.

### CSS Declerations:
- Basically, the thingns you can say, units you can use, and ways to say color.
**List of declerations**
  Property	Value	Example	Discussion
background-color	color	red	Fill the background color
border	color width style	#fad solid medium	Sets the border using shorthand where any or all of the values may be provided
border-radius	unit	50%	The size of the border radius
box-shadow	x-offset y-offset blu-radius color	2px 2px 2px gray	Creates a shadow
columns	number	3	Number of textual columns
column-rule	color width style	solid thin black	Sets the border used between columns using border shorthand
color	color	rgb(128, 0, 0)	Sets the text color
cursor	type	grab	Sets the cursor to display when hovering over the element
display	type	none	Defines how to display the element and its children
filter	filter-function	grayscale(30%)	Applies a visual filter
float	direction	right	Places the element to the left or right in the flow
flex			Flex layout. Used for responsive design
font	family size style	Arial 1.2em bold	Defines the text font using shorthand
grid			Grid layout. Used for responsive design
height	unit	.25em	Sets the height of the box
margin	unit	5px 5px 0 0	Sets the margin spacing
max-[width/height]	unit	20%	Restricts the width or height to no more than the unit
min-[width/height]	unit	10vh	Restricts the width or height to no less than the unit
opacity	number	.9	Sets how opaque the element is
overflow	[visible/hidden/scroll/auto]	scroll	Defines what happens when the content does not fix in its box
position	[static/relative/absolute/sticky]	absolute	Defines how the element is positioned in the document
padding	unit	1em 2em	Sets the padding spacing
left	unit	10rem	The horizontal value of a positioned element
text-align	[start/end/center/justify]	end	Defines how the text is aligned in the element
top	unit	50px	The vertical value of a positioned element
transform	transform-function	rotate(0.5turn)	Applies a transformation to the element
width	unit	25vmin	Sets the width of the box
z-index	number	100	Controls the positioning of the element on the z axis

This [Codepen](https://codepen.io/leesjensen/pen/rNKrgKQ) demonstrates the use of many of the above declarations. Take some time to experiment with it. Make sure you try modifying different selectors and declarations. Try different unit representations.

### CSS Fonts:
- There are four major families of fonts: Serif, sans-serif, fixed, and symbol.
- However, you can import fonts using the @font-face rule and by providing the font name and source location.
  ```
  @font-face {
  font-family: 'Quicksand';
  src: url('https://cs260.click/fonts/quicksand.ttf');
  }

  p {
    font-family: Quicksand;
  }
  ```
- If you don't want to do that you can get it from provider like google who have a large selection of open source fonts that you can use without paying any royalties. The easiest way to use Google fonts is to use a CSS import statement to reference the Google Font Service. This will automatically generate the CSS for importing the font.
  ```
  @import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Rubik Microbe&display=swap');

  p {
    font-family: 'Rubik Microbe';
  }
  ```

[CodePen](https://codepen.io/leesjensen/pen/zYaLgVW)

### CSS Animations:
-  You create CSS animations using the animation properties and defining keyframes for what the element should look like at different times in the animation.
Ex:
- We have a paragraph of centered text and we want it to zoom in until its size is 20% of the view height.
  ```
  p {
    text-align: center;
    font-size: 20vh;
  }
  ```
- Then we select the elements by adding the animation-name property with a value of demo. This name refers to the name of the keyframes that we will specify in a minute. The keyframes tell what CSS properites should be applied at different key points in the animation sequence.
-  We also add an animation-duration property in order to specify that the animation should last for three seconds.
  ```
  p {
    text-align: center;
    font-size: 20vh;
  
    animation-name: demo;
    animation-duration: 3s;
  }
  ```
- Now we are ready to create the keyframes. We need define the key points, and CSS will generate a smooth transition to move from one keyframe to another.
- So if we want to start with text that is invisible and have it zoom into the full final size. We can do this with two frames that are designated with the keywords from and to.
  ```
  @keyframes demo {
    from {
      font-size: 0vh;
    }
  
    to {
      font-size: 20vh;
    }
  }
  ```
- It would look better if towards the end, the paragraph bounced out a little bigger than its final size. We can accommodate that by adding another key frame that happens 95 percent through the animation.
  ```
  @keyframes demo {
    from {
      font-size: 0vh;
    }
  
    95% {
      font-size: 21vh;
    }
  
    to {
      font-size: 20vh;
    }
  }
  ```
